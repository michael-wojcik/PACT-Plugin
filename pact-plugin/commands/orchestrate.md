Orchestrate specialist PACT agents through the PACT workflow to address: $ARGUMENTS

---

## Team Lifecycle

The session team is created by the SessionStart hook at session initialization. Commands do not need to create teams.

**Ensure team exists**: If the team was not created (e.g., hook failure, manual session), call `TeamCreate(team_name="{feature-slug}")` before proceeding.

**Teammate lifecycle within orchestrate**:
- Teammates are spawned per phase into the session team
- Between phases, shut down current teammates before spawning next-phase teammates
- The team itself persists for the entire session (shared across commands)

---

## Task Hierarchy

Create the full Task hierarchy upfront for workflow visibility:

```
1. TaskCreate: Feature task "{verb} {feature}"
2. TaskCreate: Phase tasks (all upfront):
   - "PREPARE: {feature-slug}"
   - "ARCHITECT: {feature-slug}"
   - "CODE: {feature-slug}"
   - "TEST: {feature-slug}"
3. TaskUpdate: Set phase-to-phase blockedBy chain:
   - ARCHITECT blockedBy PREPARE
   - CODE blockedBy ARCHITECT
   - TEST blockedBy CODE
4. TaskUpdate: Feature task status = "in_progress"
```

**Scoped PACT phases**: When decomposition fires after PREPARE, the standard ARCHITECT and CODE phases are skipped (`decomposition_active`) and replaced by scoped phases. Create retroactively (detection occurs after PREPARE):
- `"ATOMIZE: {feature-slug}"` with `blockedBy = [PREPARE task ID]`
- `"CONSOLIDATE: {feature-slug}"` with `blockedBy = [all scope task IDs]`
- Add CONSOLIDATE to TEST's `blockedBy` via `addBlockedBy = [CONSOLIDATE task ID]` (the original CODE dependency auto-resolves when CODE is marked completed/skipped)

The scoped flow is: **P**repare → **A**tomize → **C**onsolidate → **T**est (same PACT acronym, scoped meanings).

For each phase execution:
```
a. TaskUpdate: phase status = "in_progress"
b. Analyze work needed (QDCL for CODE)
c. TaskCreate: agent task(s) with owner="{teammate-name}"
d. Spawn teammates (Task with team_name/name/mode="plan")
e. Review and approve teammate plans
f. Monitor: teammates self-update tasks, send HANDOFFs via SendMessage
g. Receive HANDOFFs, verify completeness
h. Shut down phase teammates
i. TaskUpdate: phase status = "completed"
```

**Skipped phases**: Mark directly `completed` (no `in_progress` — no work occurs):
`TaskUpdate(phaseTaskId, status="completed", metadata={"skipped": true, "skip_reason": "{reason}"})`
Valid reasons: `"approved_plan_exists"`, `"plan_section_complete"`, `"requirements_explicit"`, `"existing_docs_cover_scope"`, `"trivial_change"`, `"decomposition_active"`, or custom.
<!-- Skip reason semantics:
  - "approved_plan_exists": Plan exists but completeness not verified (legacy/weak)
  - "plan_section_complete": Plan exists AND section passed completeness check (preferred)
  - "requirements_explicit": Task description contains all needed context
  - "existing_docs_cover_scope": docs/preparation/ or docs/architecture/ already complete
  - "trivial_change": Change too small to warrant this phase
  - "decomposition_active": Scope detection triggered decomposition; sub-scopes handle this phase
-->

## S3/S4 Mode Awareness

This command primarily operates in **S3 mode** (operational control)—executing the plan and coordinating teammates. However, mode transitions are important:

| Phase | Primary Mode | Mode Checks |
|-------|--------------|-------------|
| **Before Starting** | S4 | Understand task, assess complexity, check for plans |
| **Context Assessment** | S4 | Should phases be skipped? What's the right approach? |
| **Phase Execution** | S3 | Coordinate teammates, track progress, clear blockers |
| **On Blocker** | S4 | Assess before responding—is this operational or strategic? |
| **Between Phases** | S4 | Still on track? Adaptation needed? |
| **After Completion** | S4 | Retrospective—what worked, what didn't? |

When transitioning to S4 mode, pause and ask: "Are we still building the right thing, or should we adapt?"

---

## Responding to Algedonic Signals

For algedonic signal handling (HALT/ALERT responses, algedonic vs imPACT distinction), see [algedonic.md](../protocols/algedonic.md).

**HALT signal handling with teammates**: When a teammate broadcasts a HALT signal, all teammates receive it via broadcast and should stop work. The lead must:
1. Acknowledge the HALT
2. Send shutdown requests to all active teammates
3. Present the signal to the user
4. Await user decision before resuming

---

## Output Conciseness

**Default: Concise output.** The orchestrator's internal reasoning (variety analysis, dependency checking, execution strategy) runs internally. User sees only decisions and key context.

| Internal (don't show) | External (show) |
|----------------------|-----------------|
| Variety dimension scores, full tables | One-line summary: `Variety: Low (5) — proceeding with orchestrate` |
| QDCL checklist, dependency analysis | Decision only: `Invoking 2 backend coders in parallel` |
| Phase skip reasoning details | Brief: `Skipping PREPARE/ARCHITECT (approved plan exists)` |

**User can always ask** for details (e.g., "Why that strategy?" or "Show me the variety analysis").

**Narration style**: State decisions, not reasoning process. Minimize commentary.

**Exceptions warranting more detail**:
- Error conditions, blockers, or unexpected issues — proactively explain what went wrong
- High-variety tasks (11+) — visible reasoning helps user track complex orchestration

| Verbose (avoid) | Concise (prefer) |
|-----------------|------------------|
| "Let me assess variety and check for the approved plan" | (just do it, show result) |
| "I'm now going to spawn the backend coder teammate" | `Spawning backend-1` |
| "S4 Mode — Task Assessment" | (implicit, don't announce) |

---

## Before Starting

### Task Variety Assessment

Before running orchestration, assess task variety using the protocol in [pact-variety.md](../protocols/pact-variety.md).

**Quick Assessment Table**:

| If task appears... | Variety Level | Action |
|-------------------|---------------|--------|
| Single file, one domain, routine | Low (4-6) | Offer comPACT using `AskUserQuestion` tool (see below) |
| Multiple files, one domain, familiar | Low-Medium | Proceed with orchestrate, consider skipping PREPARE |
| Multiple domains, some ambiguity | Medium (7-10) | Standard orchestrate with all phases |
| Greenfield, architectural decisions, unknowns | High (11-14) | Recommend plan-mode first |
| Novel technology, unclear requirements, critical stakes | Extreme (15-16) | Recommend research spike before planning |

**Variety Dimensions** (score 1-4 each, sum for total):
- **Novelty**: Routine (1) → Unprecedented (4)
- **Scope**: Single concern (1) → Cross-cutting (4)
- **Uncertainty**: Clear (1) → Unknown (4)
- **Risk**: Low impact (1) → Critical (4)

**Output format**: One-line summary only. Example: `Variety: Medium (8) — standard orchestrate with all phases`

**When uncertain**: Default to standard orchestrate. Variety can be reassessed at phase transitions.

**User override**: User can always specify their preferred workflow regardless of assessment.

### Offering comPACT for Low-Variety Tasks

When variety is Low (4-6), offer the user a choice using `AskUserQuestion` tool:

```
AskUserQuestion(
  question: "This task appears routine. Which workflow?",
  options: ["comPACT (Recommended)", "Full orchestrate"]
)
```

If comPACT selected, hand off to `/PACT:comPACT`.

---

## Execution Philosophy

**MANDATORY: Spawn concurrently unless blocked.** The burden of proof is on sequential dispatch. If you cannot cite a specific file conflict or data dependency, you MUST spawn them concurrently.

This applies across ALL phases, not just CODE:
- PREPARE with multiple research areas → multiple preparers at once
- ARCHITECT with independent component designs → multiple architects simultaneously
- CODE with multiple domains or independent tasks → multiple coders together
- TEST with independent test suites → multiple test engineers concurrently

Sequential execution is the exception requiring explicit justification. When assessing any phase, ask: "Can specialists be spawned concurrently?" The answer is usually yes.

---

1. **Set up worktree**: If already in a worktree for this feature, reuse it. Otherwise, invoke `/PACT:worktree-setup` with the feature branch name. This creates both the feature branch and its worktree. All subsequent phases work in the worktree.
2. **Check for plan** in `docs/plans/` matching this task

### Plan Status Handling

| Status | Action |
|--------|--------|
| PENDING APPROVAL | `/PACT:orchestrate` = implicit approval → update to IN_PROGRESS |
| APPROVED | Update to IN_PROGRESS |
| BLOCKED | Ask user to resolve or proceed without plan |
| IN_PROGRESS | Confirm: continue or restart? |
| SUPERSEDED/IMPLEMENTED | Confirm with user before proceeding |
| No plan found | Proceed—phases will do full discovery |

---

## Context Assessment

Before executing phases, assess which are needed based on existing context:

| Phase | Run if... | Skip if... |
|-------|-----------|------------|
| **PREPARE** | Requirements unclear, external APIs to research, dependencies unmapped | Approved plan with complete Preparation section (passes completeness check below); OR requirements explicit in task; OR existing `docs/preparation/` covers scope with no unresolved items |
| **ARCHITECT** | New component or module, interface contracts undefined, architectural decisions required | Approved plan with complete Architecture section (passes completeness check below); OR following established patterns with no new components; OR `docs/architecture/` covers design with no open items |
| **CODE** | Always run | Never skip |
| **TEST** | Integration/E2E tests needed, complex component interactions, security/performance verification | ALL of the following are true: (1) trivial change with no new logic requiring tests, (2) no integration boundaries crossed, (3) isolated change with no meaningful test scenarios, AND (4) plan's Phase Requirements section does not mark TEST as REQUIRED (if plan exists) |

**Conflict resolution**: When both "Run if" and "Skip if" criteria apply, **run the phase** (safer default). Example: A plan exists but requirements have changed—run PREPARE to validate.

**Plan-aware fast path**: When an approved plan exists in `docs/plans/`, PREPARE and ARCHITECT are typically skippable—the plan already synthesized specialist perspectives. Skip unless scope has changed, plan appears stale (typically >2 weeks; ask user to confirm if uncertain), OR the plan contains incompleteness signals for that phase (see Phase Skip Completeness Check below).

**State your assessment briefly.** Example: `Skipping PREPARE/ARCHITECT (approved plan exists). Running CODE and TEST.`

The user can override your assessment or ask for details.

### Phase Skip Completeness Check

**Principle: Existence ≠ Completeness.**

Before skipping, scan the plan section for incompleteness signals (see [pact-completeness.md](../protocols/pact-completeness.md)):
- [ ] No unchecked research items (`- [ ]`)
- [ ] No TBD values in decision tables
- [ ] No `⚠️ Handled during {PHASE_NAME}` forward references
- [ ] No unchecked questions to resolve
- [ ] No empty/placeholder sections
- [ ] No unresolved open questions

**All clear** → Skip with reason `"plan_section_complete"` (not `"approved_plan_exists"`)
**Any signal present** → Run the phase

> **Note**: The plan's Phase Requirements table is advisory. When in doubt, verify against actual section content — the table may be stale if the plan was updated after initial synthesis.

**Scope detection**: After PREPARE completes (or is skipped), scope detection evaluates whether the task warrants decomposition into sub-scopes. See [Scope Detection Evaluation](#scope-detection-evaluation) below.

---

## Handling Decisions When Phases Were Skipped

When a phase is skipped but a coder encounters a decision that would have been handled by that phase:

| Decision Scope | Examples | Action |
|----------------|----------|--------|
| **Minor** | Naming conventions, local file structure, error message wording | Coder decides, documents in commit message |
| **Moderate** | Interface shape within your module, error handling pattern, internal component boundaries | Coder decides and implements, but flags decision with rationale in handoff; orchestrator validates before next phase |
| **Major** | New module needed, cross-module contract, architectural pattern affecting multiple components | Blocker → `/PACT:imPACT` → may need to run skipped phase |

**Boundary heuristic**: If a decision affects files outside the current specialist's scope, treat it as Major.

**Coder instruction when phases were skipped**:

> "PREPARE and/or ARCHITECT were skipped based on existing context. Minor decisions (naming, local structure) are yours to make. For moderate decisions (interface shape, error patterns), decide and implement but flag the decision with your rationale in the handoff so it can be validated. Major decisions affecting other components are blockers—don't implement, escalate."

---

## Teammate Spawning Pattern

### Spawning Teammates

Spawn teammates using `Task` with team parameters. All teammates for a phase are spawned in a single message as parallel tool calls:

```
Lead: Single message (all parallel tool calls):
├── TaskCreate("Research area A", owner="preparer-1")
├── TaskCreate("Research area B", owner="preparer-2")
├── Task(subagent_type="pact-preparer", team_name="{team}", name="preparer-1", mode="plan", prompt="...")
└── Task(subagent_type="pact-preparer", team_name="{team}", name="preparer-2", mode="plan", prompt="...")
```

**Parameters**:
- `subagent_type`: The agent definition to use (e.g., `"pact-backend-coder"`)
- `team_name`: The session team name (from hook or TeamCreate)
- `name`: A discoverable name for the teammate (e.g., `"backend-1"`, `"preparer-1"`)
- `mode`: Set to `"plan"` to require Plan Approval before implementation
- `prompt`: The task description, context, and instructions

**Naming convention**: `{role}-{number}` (e.g., `"backend-1"`, `"architect-2"`, `"preparer-1"`). For scoped orchestration: `"scope-{scope}-{role}"` (e.g., `"scope-auth-backend"`, `"scope-billing-frontend"`).

### Plan Approval Workflow

All teammates are spawned with `mode="plan"` (plan approval required). The workflow:

1. **Teammate analyzes task** and creates a plan.
2. **Teammate submits plan** via ExitPlanMode.
3. **Lead reviews the plan** — receives it as a plan approval request message.
4. **Lead approves or rejects**:
   ```
   SendMessage(type: "plan_approval_response", request_id: "{id}", recipient: "{teammate-name}", approve: true)
   ```
   Or to reject with feedback:
   ```
   SendMessage(type: "plan_approval_response", request_id: "{id}", recipient: "{teammate-name}", approve: false, content: "Please also consider X")
   ```
5. **After approval**, teammate proceeds with implementation.
6. **If rejected**, teammate revises and resubmits.

**Review all plans for a phase before approving any** — this allows the lead to identify conflicts, overlaps, or gaps across the phase's work items before implementation begins.

### Shutting Down Teammates Between Phases

Before proceeding to the next phase, shut down all current-phase teammates:

```
SendMessage(type: "shutdown_request", recipient: "{teammate-name}", content: "Phase complete. Shutting down.")
```

Send shutdown requests to each active teammate. Teammates respond with shutdown approval or rejection. Wait for all shutdowns to be acknowledged before spawning next-phase teammates.

**If a teammate rejects shutdown**: It may still be completing work. Check TaskList for its task status. If the task is complete, re-send the shutdown request. If incomplete, wait for completion.

---

### PREPARE Phase → `pact-preparer`

**Skip criteria met (including completeness check)?** → Proceed to ARCHITECT phase.

**Plan sections to pass** (if plan exists):
- "Preparation Phase"
- "Open Questions > Require Further Research"

**Spawn `pact-preparer` teammate(s) with**:
- Task description
- Plan sections above (if any)
- "Reference the approved plan at `docs/plans/{slug}-plan.md` for full context."

**Example spawn**:
```
TaskCreate("Research auth patterns and API contracts", owner="preparer-1")
Task(subagent_type="pact-preparer", team_name="{team}", name="preparer-1", mode="plan",
  prompt="CONTEXT: ... MISSION: ... INSTRUCTIONS: ... GUIDELINES: ...")
```

**Before next phase**:
- [ ] Outputs exist in `docs/preparation/`
- [ ] HANDOFF received from each preparer (via SendMessage)
- [ ] If blocker reported (via SendMessage) → `/PACT:imPACT`
- [ ] Shut down all preparer teammates
- [ ] **S4 Checkpoint** (see [pact-s4-checkpoints.md](../protocols/pact-s4-checkpoints.md)): Environment stable? Model aligned? Plan viable?

**Concurrent dispatch within PREPARE**: If research spans multiple independent areas (e.g., "research auth options AND caching strategies"), spawn multiple preparers together with clear scope boundaries.

---

### Post-PREPARE Re-assessment

If PREPARE ran and ARCHITECT was marked "Skip," compare PREPARE's recommended approach to the skip rationale:

- **Approach matches rationale** → Skip holds
- **Novel approach** (new components, interfaces, expanded scope) → Override, run ARCHITECT

**Example**:
> Skip rationale: "following established pattern in `src/utils/`"
> PREPARE recommends "add helper to existing utils" → Skip holds
> PREPARE recommends "new ValidationService class" → Override, run ARCHITECT

---

### Scope Detection Evaluation

After PREPARE completes (or is skipped with plan context), evaluate whether the task warrants decomposition into sub-scopes. For heuristic definitions and scoring, see [pact-scope-detection.md](../protocols/pact-scope-detection.md).

**When**: After PREPARE output is available (or plan content, if PREPARE was skipped). comPACT bypasses detection entirely.

**Process**:
1. Score the task against the heuristics table in the protocol
2. Apply counter-signals to adjust the score downward
3. Determine tier:

| Result | Action |
|--------|--------|
| Score below threshold | Single scope — continue with standard flow |
| Score at/above threshold | Propose decomposition (see Evaluation Response below) |
| All strong signals fire, no counter-signals, autonomous enabled | Auto-decompose (see Evaluation Response below) |

**Output format**: `Scope detection: Single scope (score 2/3 threshold)` or `Scope detection: Multi-scope detected (score 4/3 threshold) — proposing decomposition`

#### Evaluation Response

When detection fires (score >= threshold), follow the evaluation response protocol in [pact-scope-detection.md](../protocols/pact-scope-detection.md) — S5 confirmation flow, user response mapping, and autonomous tier.

**On confirmed decomposition**: Generate a scope contract for each sub-scope before spawning teammates. See [pact-scope-contract.md](../protocols/pact-scope-contract.md) for the contract format and generation process. Skip top-level ARCHITECT and CODE — mark both `completed` with `{"skipped": true, "skip_reason": "decomposition_active"}`. The workflow switches to scoped PACT phases: ATOMIZE (dispatch sub-scopes) → CONSOLIDATE (verify contracts) → TEST (comprehensive feature testing). See ATOMIZE Phase and CONSOLIDATE Phase below.

---

### ARCHITECT Phase → `pact-architect`

**Skip criteria met (including completeness check, after re-assessment)?** → Proceed to CODE phase.

**Plan sections to pass** (if plan exists):
- "Architecture Phase"
- "Key Decisions"
- "Interface Contracts"

**Spawn `pact-architect` teammate(s) with**:
- Task description
- PREPARE phase outputs:
  - Tell `pact-architect` where to find them (e.g., "Read `docs/preparation/{feature}.md` for research context")
  - Do not read the files yourself or paste their content into the prompt
  - If PREPARE was skipped: pass the plan's Preparation Phase section instead
- Plan sections above (if any)
- "Reference the approved plan at `docs/plans/{slug}-plan.md` for full context."

**Example spawn**:
```
TaskCreate("Design auth service architecture", owner="architect-1")
Task(subagent_type="pact-architect", team_name="{team}", name="architect-1", mode="plan",
  prompt="CONTEXT: ... MISSION: ... INSTRUCTIONS: ... GUIDELINES: ...")
```

**Before next phase**:
- [ ] Outputs exist in `docs/architecture/`
- [ ] HANDOFF received from each architect (via SendMessage)
- [ ] If blocker reported (via SendMessage) → `/PACT:imPACT`
- [ ] Shut down all architect teammates
- [ ] **S4 Checkpoint**: Environment stable? Model aligned? Plan viable?

**Concurrent dispatch within ARCHITECT**: If designing multiple independent components (e.g., "design user service AND notification service"), spawn multiple architects simultaneously. Ensure interface contracts between components are defined as a coordination checkpoint.

---

### CODE Phase → `pact-*-coder(s)`

**Always runs.** This is the core work.

> **S5 Policy Checkpoint (Pre-CODE)**: Before spawning coders, verify:
> 1. "Does the architecture align with project principles?"
> 2. "Am I delegating ALL code changes to specialists?" (orchestrator writes no application code)
> 3. "Are there any S5 non-negotiables at risk?"
>
> **Delegation reminder**: Even if you identified the exact implementation during earlier phases, you must delegate the actual coding. Knowing what to build ≠ permission to build it yourself.

**Plan sections to pass** (if plan exists):
- "Code Phase"
- "Implementation Sequence"
- "Commit Sequence"

**Select coder(s)** based on scope:
- `pact-backend-coder` — server-side logic, APIs
- `pact-frontend-coder` — UI, client-side
- `pact-database-engineer` — schema, queries, migrations

#### Spawn Concurrently by Default

**Default stance**: Spawn specialists together unless proven dependent. Sequential requires explicit justification.

**Required decision output** (no exceptions):
- "**Concurrent**: [groupings]" — the expected outcome
- "**Sequential because [specific reason]**: [ordering]" — requires explicit justification
- "**Mixed**: [concurrent groupings], then [sequential dependencies]" — when genuinely mixed

**Deviation from concurrent dispatch requires articulated reasoning.** "I'm not sure" defaults to concurrent with S2 coordination, not sequential.

**Analysis should complete quickly.** Use the Quick Dependency Checklist (QDCL) below. If QDCL analysis takes more than 2 minutes, you're likely over-analyzing independent tasks—default to concurrent dispatch with S2 coordination.

#### Execution Strategy Analysis

**REQUIRED**: Complete the QDCL internally before spawning coders.

**Quick Dependency Checklist (QDCL)** — run mentally, don't output:

For each pair of work units, check:
- Same file modified? → Sequential (or define strict boundaries)
- A's output is B's input? → Sequential (A first)
- Shared interface undefined? → Define interface first, then concurrent
- None of above? → Concurrent

**Output format**: Decision only. Example: `Spawning backend-1 + frontend-1 in parallel` or `Sequential: database-1 first, then backend-1 (schema dependency)`

**If QDCL shows no dependencies**: Concurrent is your answer. Don't second-guess.

#### S2 Pre-Dispatch Coordination

Before concurrent dispatch, check internally: shared files? shared interfaces? conventions established?

- **Shared files**: Sequence those teammates OR assign clear boundaries
- **Conventions**: First teammate's choice becomes standard; propagate to others
- **Resolution authority**: Technical disagreements → Architect arbitrates; Style/convention → First teammate's choice

**Output**: Silent if no conflicts; only mention if conflicts found (e.g., `S2 check: types.ts shared — backend-1 writes, frontend-1 reads`).

**Include in prompts for concurrent specialists**: "You are working concurrently with other specialists. Your scope is [files]. Do not modify files outside your scope."

**Include worktree path in all teammate prompts**: "You are working in a git worktree at [worktree_path]. All file paths must be absolute and within this worktree."

**Spawn coder teammate(s) with**:
- Task description
- ARCHITECT phase outputs:
  - Tell the coder(s) where to find them (e.g., "Read `docs/architecture/{feature}.md` for design context")
  - Do not read the files yourself or paste their content into the prompt
  - If ARCHITECT was skipped: pass the plan's Architecture Phase section instead
- Plan sections above (if any)
- "Reference the approved plan at `docs/plans/{slug}-plan.md` for full context."
- If PREPARE/ARCHITECT were skipped, include: "PREPARE and/or ARCHITECT were skipped based on existing context. Minor decisions (naming, local structure) are yours to make. For moderate decisions (interface shape, error patterns), decide and implement but flag the decision with your rationale in the handoff so it can be validated. Major decisions affecting other components are blockers—don't implement, escalate."
- "Smoke Testing: Run the test suite before completing. If your changes break existing tests, fix them. Your tests are verification tests—enough to confirm your implementation works. Comprehensive coverage (edge cases, integration, E2E, adversarial) is TEST phase work."

**Example spawn (concurrent)**:
```
TaskCreate("Implement auth endpoint", owner="backend-1")
TaskCreate("Implement billing endpoint", owner="backend-2")
TaskCreate("Build dashboard UI", owner="frontend-1")
Task(subagent_type="pact-backend-coder", team_name="{team}", name="backend-1", mode="plan",
  prompt="CONTEXT: ... MISSION: Implement auth endpoint ... GUIDELINES: ...")
Task(subagent_type="pact-backend-coder", team_name="{team}", name="backend-2", mode="plan",
  prompt="CONTEXT: ... MISSION: Implement billing endpoint ... GUIDELINES: ...")
Task(subagent_type="pact-frontend-coder", team_name="{team}", name="frontend-1", mode="plan",
  prompt="CONTEXT: ... MISSION: Build dashboard UI ... GUIDELINES: ...")
```

**Before next phase**:
- [ ] Implementation complete (all coder HANDOFFs received via SendMessage)
- [ ] All tests passing (full test suite; fix any tests your changes break)
- [ ] If blocker reported (via SendMessage) → `/PACT:imPACT`
- [ ] Shut down all coder teammates
- [ ] **Create atomic commit(s)** of CODE phase work (preserves work before strategic re-assessment)
- [ ] **S4 Checkpoint**: Environment stable? Model aligned? Plan viable?

#### Handling Complex Sub-Tasks During CODE

If a sub-task emerges that is too complex for a single specialist:

| Sub-Task Complexity | Indicators | Use |
|---------------------|------------|-----|
| **Simple** | Code-only, clear requirements | Direct specialist teammate |
| **Focused** | Single domain, no research needed | `/PACT:comPACT` |
| **Complex** | Needs own P→A→C→T cycle | `/PACT:orchestrate` (new orchestration) |

**Phase re-entry** (via `/PACT:imPACT`): When imPACT decides to redo a prior phase, create a new retry phase task — do not reopen the completed one. See [imPACT.md Phase Re-Entry Task Protocol](imPACT.md#phase-re-entry-task-protocol) for details.

---

### ATOMIZE Phase (Scoped Orchestration Only)

Execute the [ATOMIZE Phase protocol](../protocols/pact-scope-phases.md#atomize-phase).

**Teammate spawning for sub-scopes**: All sub-scope teammates join the flat session team. Use scoped naming (`"scope-{scope}-{role}"`) for clear identification. Each sub-scope teammate receives its scope contract in the prompt.

**Worktree isolation**: Before spawning sub-scope teammates, invoke `/PACT:worktree-setup` with the suffix branch name (e.g., `feature-X--backend`). Pass the resulting worktree path to each sub-scope teammate's prompt.

**Example spawn (ATOMIZE)**:
```
TaskCreate("Scope-auth: design + implement", owner="scope-auth-architect")
TaskCreate("Scope-auth: implement backend", owner="scope-auth-backend")
TaskCreate("Scope-billing: design + implement", owner="scope-billing-architect")
Task(subagent_type="pact-architect", team_name="{team}", name="scope-auth-architect", mode="plan",
  prompt="SCOPE CONTRACT: {auth scope contract} ... WORKTREE: {auth-worktree-path} ...")
Task(subagent_type="pact-backend-coder", team_name="{team}", name="scope-auth-backend", mode="plan",
  prompt="SCOPE CONTRACT: {auth scope contract} ... WORKTREE: {auth-worktree-path} ... BLOCKED UNTIL scope-auth-architect completes design")
Task(subagent_type="pact-architect", team_name="{team}", name="scope-billing-architect", mode="plan",
  prompt="SCOPE CONTRACT: {billing scope contract} ... WORKTREE: {billing-worktree-path} ...")
```

---

### CONSOLIDATE Phase (Scoped Orchestration Only)

Execute the [CONSOLIDATE Phase protocol](../protocols/pact-scope-phases.md#consolidate-phase).

**Worktree cleanup**: After merging each sub-scope branch back to the feature branch, invoke `/PACT:worktree-cleanup` for that sub-scope's worktree.

---

### TEST Phase → `pact-test-engineer`

**Skip criteria met?** → Proceed to "After All Phases Complete."

**Plan sections to pass** (if plan exists):
- "Test Phase"
- "Test Scenarios"
- "Coverage Targets"

**Spawn `pact-test-engineer` teammate(s) with**:
- Task description
- CODE phase handoff(s): Pass coder handoff summaries (received via SendMessage)
- Plan sections above (if any)
- "Reference the approved plan at `docs/plans/{slug}-plan.md` for full context."
- "You own ALL substantive testing: unit tests, integration, E2E, edge cases."

**Example spawn**:
```
TaskCreate("Unit and integration tests", owner="test-1")
TaskCreate("E2E and performance tests", owner="test-2")
Task(subagent_type="pact-test-engineer", team_name="{team}", name="test-1", mode="plan",
  prompt="CONTEXT: ... MISSION: Write unit and integration tests ... GUIDELINES: ...")
Task(subagent_type="pact-test-engineer", team_name="{team}", name="test-2", mode="plan",
  prompt="CONTEXT: ... MISSION: Write E2E and performance tests ... GUIDELINES: ...")
```

**Before completing**:
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] HANDOFF received from each test engineer (via SendMessage)
- [ ] If blocker reported (via SendMessage) → `/PACT:imPACT`
- [ ] Shut down all test engineer teammates
- [ ] **Create atomic commit(s)** of TEST phase work (preserves work before strategic re-assessment)

**Concurrent dispatch within TEST**: If test suites are independent (e.g., "unit tests AND E2E tests" or "API tests AND UI tests"), spawn multiple test engineers at once with clear suite boundaries.

---

## Teammate Monitoring

### How Teammates Communicate

Teammates communicate via SendMessage. The lead's inbox receives these automatically:
- **HANDOFF messages**: Structured completion report (5-item format)
- **BLOCKER messages**: Stop-work notification with partial handoff
- **ALGEDONIC messages**: HALT (broadcast to all) or ALERT (direct to lead)
- **Plan approval requests**: Teammate submitting plan for review

### Monitoring Progress

Use TaskList to monitor teammate progress:
- Teammates self-update their task status via TaskUpdate
- TaskList shows all tasks with current status and owner

**Check TaskList**:
- After spawning each phase's teammates
- When a teammate sends a HANDOFF message
- When a teammate reports a blocker
- Periodically during long-running phases

### Handling Teammate Messages

| Message Type | Action |
|--------------|--------|
| Plan approval request | Review plan, approve or reject |
| HANDOFF | Verify completeness (5 items), mark phase progress |
| BLOCKER | Assess severity → `/PACT:imPACT` if needed |
| ALGEDONIC HALT | Stop all work, present to user immediately |
| ALGEDONIC ALERT | Pause, assess, present to user |
| Peer coordination question | Typically no lead action needed (teammate-to-teammate) |

## Agent Stall Detection

For stall detection indicators, recovery protocol, prevention, and non-happy-path task termination, see [pact-agent-stall.md](../protocols/pact-agent-stall.md).

**Teammate-specific stall indicators**:
- Teammate has not sent any message for an extended period
- TaskList shows task stuck in `in_progress` with no recent updates
- Teammate's plan approval was sent but no plan received

**Recovery**: Send a message to the teammate asking for status. If no response, send a shutdown request and re-spawn a new teammate for the task.

## Signal Monitoring

Check TaskList and inbox for blocker/algedonic signals:
- After spawning each phase's teammates
- When a teammate sends a message
- On any unexpected teammate stoppage

On signal detected: Follow Signal Task Handling in CLAUDE.md.

## After All Phases Complete

> **S5 Policy Checkpoint (Pre-PR)**: Before creating PR, verify: "Do all tests pass? Is system integrity maintained? Have S5 non-negotiables been respected throughout?"

1. **Update plan status** (if plan exists): IN_PROGRESS → IMPLEMENTED
2. **Verify all work is committed** — CODE and TEST phase commits should already exist; if any uncommitted changes remain, commit them now
3. **TaskUpdate**: Feature task status = "completed" (all phases done, all work committed)
4. **Run `/PACT:peer-review`** to create PR and get multi-agent review
5. **Present review summary and stop** — orchestrator never merges (S5 policy)
6. **S4 Retrospective** (after user decides): Briefly note—what worked well? What should we adapt for next time?
7. **High-variety audit trail** (variety 10+ only): Delegate to `pact-memory-agent` to save key orchestration decisions, S3/S4 tensions resolved, and lessons learned
