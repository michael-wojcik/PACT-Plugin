Create a comprehensive implementation plan for: $ARGUMENTS

**This is PLANNING ONLY** -- no code changes, no git branches, no implementation.

---

## Task Hierarchy

Create a planning Task hierarchy:

```
1. TaskCreate: Planning task "Plan: {feature}"
2. TaskUpdate: Planning task status = "in_progress"
3. Analyze: Which specialists to consult?
4. TaskCreate: Consultation task(s) -- one per specialist
5. Spawn consultant teammates into the session team (planning-only mode)
6. Consultants submit analysis plans for lead approval
7. After approval, consultants analyze and send perspectives via SendMessage
8. Collect perspectives as messages arrive
9. Shutdown consultants after all perspectives received
10. TaskUpdate: Consultation tasks status = "completed"
11. Synthesize -> write plan document
12. TaskUpdate: Planning task status = "completed", metadata.artifact = plan path
```

**Example structure:**
```
[Planning] "Plan: user authentication"      (blockedBy: consult1, consult2, consult3)
|-- [Consult] "preparer: research auth patterns"
|-- [Consult] "architect: design auth service"
+-- [Consult] "test-engineer: testing strategy"
```

## S4 Intelligence Function

This command is the primary **S4 (Intelligence)** activity in PACT. While `/PACT:orchestrate` operates mainly in S3 mode (execution), `plan-mode` operates entirely in S4 mode:

- **Outside focus**: What does the environment require? What are the constraints?
- **Future focus**: What approach will lead to long-term success?
- **Strategic thinking**: What are the risks? What could change?

The output -- an approved plan -- bridges S4 intelligence to S3 execution. When `/PACT:orchestrate` runs, it shifts to S3 mode while referencing the S4 plan.

**S4 Questions to Hold Throughout**:
- Are we solving the right problem?
- What could invalidate this approach?
- What are we assuming that might be wrong?
- How might requirements change?

---

## Variety Context

plan-mode is the recommended entry point for **high-variety tasks** (variety score 11-14). It builds understanding before committing to execution.

If variety assessment suggests:
- **Low/Medium variety (4-10)**: Consider recommending `/PACT:comPACT` or direct `/PACT:orchestrate` instead
- **Extreme variety (15-16)**: Consider recommending a research spike first (run PREPARE phase alone)

See [pact-variety.md](../protocols/pact-variety.md) for the Variety Management assessment protocol.

## Your Workflow

### Phase 0: Orchestrator Analysis

Using extended thinking, analyze the task:
- What is the full scope of this task?
- Which PACT phases are involved?
- Which specialists should be consulted?
- What are the key planning questions for each specialist?
- What's the estimated complexity (Low/Medium/High/Very High)?

Determine which specialists to invoke based on the task:
- **pact-preparer**: Always include for research/context needs
- **pact-architect**: Include for any structural or design decisions
- **pact-backend-coder**: Include if server-side work is involved
- **pact-frontend-coder**: Include if client-side work is involved
- **pact-database-engineer**: Include if data layer work is involved
- **pact-test-engineer**: Always include for testing strategy

Skip specialists clearly not relevant (e.g., skip database engineer for pure UI work).

**Derive the feature slug** for the plan filename:
- Convert task to lowercase kebab-case
- Keep it concise (3-5 words max)
- Examples:
  - "Add user authentication with JWT" -> `user-auth-jwt`
  - "Refactor payment processing module" -> `refactor-payment-processing`
  - "Fix dashboard loading performance" -> `fix-dashboard-performance`

### Phase 1: Spawn Consultant Teammates

Spawn relevant specialists **in parallel** into the session team, each in **planning-only mode** using `mode="plan"`.

#### Consultant Spawn Pattern

```
Task(
  subagent_type="pact-preparer",
  team_name="{team}",
  name="preparer-consultant",
  mode="plan",
  prompt="..."
)

Task(
  subagent_type="pact-architect",
  team_name="{team}",
  name="architect-consultant",
  mode="plan",
  prompt="..."
)

Task(
  subagent_type="pact-test-engineer",
  team_name="{team}",
  name="test-consultant",
  mode="plan",
  prompt="..."
)
```

Add domain coders as needed:
```
Task(
  subagent_type="pact-backend-coder",
  team_name="{team}",
  name="backend-consultant",
  mode="plan",
  prompt="..."
)
```

#### Consultant Prompt Template

```
PLANNING CONSULTATION ONLY -- No implementation, no code changes.
You are a consultant teammate providing planning perspective.

Task: {task description}

As the {role} specialist, provide your planning perspective:

1. SCOPE IN YOUR DOMAIN
   - What work is needed in your area of expertise?
   - What's the estimated effort (Low/Medium/High)?

2. DEPENDENCIES & INTERFACES
   - What dependencies exist with other domains?
   - What interfaces or contracts need definition?
   - What do you need from other specialists?

3. KEY DECISIONS & TRADE-OFFS
   - What are the important decisions in your domain?
   - What are the options and trade-offs?
   - What's your recommendation?

4. RISKS & CONCERNS
   - What could go wrong?
   - What unknowns need investigation?
   - What assumptions are you making?

5. RECOMMENDED APPROACH
   - What's your suggested approach?
   - What sequence of steps do you recommend?
   - What should be done first?

WORKFLOW:
1. Submit an analysis plan (via ExitPlanMode) describing what you will examine.
2. After plan approval, perform your analysis.
3. Send your perspective to the lead via SendMessage with clear headers matching the 5 sections above.
4. Mark your task complete via TaskUpdate.

Do NOT implement anything -- planning consultation only.
```

**Domain-specific additions to the template:**

For **pact-preparer**, also ask:
- What documentation/research is needed before implementation?
- What external APIs or libraries need investigation?
- What stakeholder clarifications are needed?

For **pact-architect**, also ask:
- What components/modules are affected or needed?
- What design patterns should be applied?
- What interface contracts need definition?

For **coders** (backend/frontend/database), also ask:
- What files need modification or creation?
- What existing patterns in the codebase should be followed?
- What's the implementation sequence?

For **pact-test-engineer**, also ask:
- What test scenarios are critical (happy path, errors, edge cases)?
- What coverage targets make sense?
- What test data or fixtures are needed?

#### Plan Approval for Consultants

When a consultant submits their analysis plan via ExitPlanMode:
1. Receive the plan approval request message
2. Review the plan -- ensure it covers the consultant's assigned domain
3. Approve or reject with feedback:
   ```
   SendMessage(type: "plan_approval_response",
     request_id: "{request_id}",
     recipient: "{consultant-name}",
     approve: true)
   ```
4. If rejected, provide specific guidance on what to analyze

#### Collecting Perspectives

Perspectives arrive as SendMessage deliveries from consultant teammates. As each perspective arrives:
1. Record the perspective content
2. TaskUpdate the consultant's task as `completed`
3. When all perspectives are collected, proceed to shutdown and synthesis

#### Shutting Down Consultants

After all perspectives are collected, shutdown each consultant:

```
SendMessage(type: "shutdown_request",
  recipient: "{consultant-name}",
  content: "Planning consultation complete, shutting down")
```

Consultants will approve the shutdown via their pact-task-tracking protocol.

**Handling incomplete or missing responses**:

If a consultant provides minimal, incomplete, or off-topic output:
1. Note the gap -- record which consultant and which sections are missing
2. Proceed with synthesis -- use the inputs you have
3. Flag in the plan -- add to "Limitations" section with specific gaps identified
4. Do NOT re-invoke -- avoid infinite loops; missing input is data for the plan

If a consultant fails entirely (timeout, error, unexpected stoppage):
1. Log the failure in synthesis notes
2. Proceed without that perspective
3. Flag prominently in "Open Questions" that this domain was not consulted
4. Recommend the user consider re-running plan-mode or consulting that specialist manually

### Phase 2: Orchestrator Synthesis

After collecting all consultant outputs, use extended thinking to synthesize:

1. **Identify Agreements**
   - Where do specialists align?
   - What's the consensus approach?

2. **Identify and Classify Conflicts**

   Where do specialists disagree? Classify each conflict:

   | Severity | Definition | Action |
   |----------|------------|--------|
   | **Minor** | Different approaches, either works | Orchestrator chooses, documents rationale |
   | **Major** | Fundamental disagreement affecting design | Flag for user decision with options |
   | **Blocking** | Cannot proceed without resolution | Escalate immediately (see below) |

   **Blocking conflict escalation**:
   If a conflict prevents meaningful synthesis (e.g., two specialists propose mutually exclusive architectures):
   1. Stop synthesis
   2. Present partial plan with explicit "BLOCKED" status
   3. Clearly describe the conflict and why it blocks progress
   4. Ask user to resolve before continuing
   5. User may re-run plan-mode after providing direction

3. **Determine Sequencing**
   - What's the optimal order of phases?
   - What can be invoked concurrently?
   - What are the dependencies?

4. **Assess Cross-Cutting Concerns**
   - Security implications?
   - Performance implications?
   - Accessibility implications? (if frontend)
   - Observability/logging needs?

5. **Build Unified Roadmap**
   - Create step-by-step implementation plan
   - Map steps to specialists
   - Identify the commit sequence
   - Populate "Phase Requirements" section based on completeness analysis:
     - Check each phase's plan section for these incompleteness signals:
       - [ ] Unchecked research items (`- [ ]`)
       - [ ] TBD values in decision tables
       - [ ] `⚠️ Handled during {PHASE_NAME}` forward references
       - [ ] Unchecked questions to resolve
       - [ ] Empty/placeholder sections
       - [ ] Unresolved open questions
     - **Any signal present** -> mark phase as REQUIRED
       - For more details on incompleteness signals, see [pact-completeness.md](../protocols/pact-completeness.md)

6. **Risk Assessment**
   - Aggregate risks from all specialists
   - Assess overall project risk
   - Identify mitigation strategies

7. **Synthesis Validation Checkpoint**

   Before proceeding to Phase 3, verify:
   - [ ] At least 2 specialists contributed meaningful input
   - [ ] No blocking conflicts remain unresolved
   - [ ] All mandatory plan sections can be populated
   - [ ] Cross-cutting concerns have been considered

   If validation fails:
   - For insufficient specialist input -> Flag in "Limitations", proceed with available data
   - For unresolved blocking conflict -> Present partial plan with BLOCKED status
   - For missing mandatory sections -> Populate with "TBD - requires {specific input}"

### Phase 3: Plan Output

**TaskUpdate**: Planning task completed with artifact path:
```
TaskUpdate(
  taskId=planning_task_id,
  status="completed",
  metadata={
    "artifact": "docs/plans/{feature-slug}-plan.md",
    "summary": "Planning complete. Awaiting user approval."
  }
)
```

Save the synthesized plan to `docs/plans/{feature-slug}-plan.md`.

**Handling existing plans**:

If a plan already exists for this feature slug:
1. Check the existing plan's status and use `AskUserQuestion` tool when user input is needed:
   - **PENDING APPROVAL**: Ask user with options: "Overwrite existing plan" / "Rename new plan" / "Cancel"
   - **APPROVED**: Ask user with options: "Overwrite (plan not yet started)" / "Cancel"
   - **IN_PROGRESS**: Warn that implementation is underway, ask with options: "Overwrite anyway" / "Cancel"
   - **IMPLEMENTED**: Previous version completed; create new version with date suffix (no question needed)
   - **SUPERSEDED**: Safe to overwrite (no question needed)
2. If creating a new version:
   - First attempt: `{feature-slug}-plan-{YYYY-MM-DD}.md`
   - If that exists: `{feature-slug}-plan-{YYYY-MM-DD}-v2.md` (increment as needed)
3. Update the old plan's status to SUPERSEDED if overwriting

**Use this structure:**

```markdown
# Implementation Plan: {Feature Name}

> Generated by `/PACT:plan-mode` on {YYYY-MM-DD}
> Status: PENDING APPROVAL

<!-- Status Lifecycle:
     PENDING APPROVAL -> APPROVED -> IN_PROGRESS -> IMPLEMENTED
                    \-> SUPERSEDED (if replaced by newer plan)
                    \-> BLOCKED (if unresolved conflicts)

     Transition Ownership:
     - PENDING APPROVAL -> APPROVED: User (explicit approval)
     - APPROVED -> IN_PROGRESS: Orchestrator (when /PACT:orchestrate starts)
     - IN_PROGRESS -> IMPLEMENTED: Orchestrator (after successful completion)
     - Any -> SUPERSEDED: plan-mode (when creating replacement plan)
     - Any -> BLOCKED: plan-mode (when unresolved blocking conflicts)
-->

<!-- Forward Reference Convention:
     When deferring work to a later phase, use the standardized format:
     "⚠️ Handled during {PHASE_NAME}" (e.g., "⚠️ Handled during PREPARE")
     This format is detected by the orchestrator's phase-skip completeness check.
     Do NOT use informal variants like "deferred to", "will be addressed in", etc.
-->

## Phase Requirements

> Auto-populated based on plan content. The orchestrator uses this section to determine which phases to run.

<!-- Re-derive this table whenever plan content changes after initial synthesis (e.g., user decisions in Phase 4).
     The "any signal = REQUIRED" default is conservative, but stale rationale text can mislead the orchestrator. -->

| Phase | Required? | Rationale |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| PREPARE | {Yes/No} | {e.g., "Yes -- 3 unchecked research items remain" or "No -- all research complete, no TBD items"} |
| ARCHITECT | {Yes/No} | {e.g., "Yes -- interface contracts marked TBD" or "No -- all design decisions resolved"} |
| CODE | Yes | Always required |
| TEST | {Yes/No} | {e.g., "Yes -- integration tests needed" or "No -- trivial change, no test scenarios"} |

---

## Next Steps

To implement this plan after approval:
```
/PACT:orchestrate {task description}
```

The orchestrator should reference this plan during execution.
```

---

## Signal Monitoring

Monitor for blocker/algedonic signals:
- After spawning each consultant
- After plan approval for each consultant
- When consultant sends their perspective
- On any unexpected consultant stoppage

On signal detected: Follow Signal Task Handling in CLAUDE.md.

---

## Output Conciseness

**Default: Concise output.** User sees plan summary and decision points, not synthesis process.

| Internal (don't show) | External (show) |
|----------------------|-----------------|
| Specialist consultation reasoning | `Spawning: preparer, architect, backend, test consultants` |
| Conflict resolution analysis | Summary in plan document |
| Synthesis process details | `Plan saved to docs/plans/{slug}-plan.md` |

**User can always ask** for details (e.g., "What did the architect recommend?" or "Show me the conflicts").

| Verbose (avoid) | Concise (prefer) |
|-----------------|------------------|
| "The plan has been created. Let me walk you through..." | `Plan saved. Complexity: Medium. 3 decisions need your input.` |
| "I'm now synthesizing the specialist perspectives..." | (just do it, present result) |

---

### Phase 4: Present and Resolve

After saving the plan:

1. Present a concise summary to the user
2. Note the **overall complexity and scope**

**Resolve open questions before exiting plan mode:**

3. If there are items under **"Open Questions > Require User Decision"**:
   - Use `AskUserQuestion` to resolve each decision point
   - Update the plan file with the user's decisions (move resolved items to the appropriate sections, e.g., "Key Decisions")
   - Repeat until no "Require User Decision" items remain

4. Once all decision-requiring questions are resolved:
   - Re-derive the Phase Requirements table based on updated plan content (incompleteness signals may have changed after user decisions)
   - Highlight any remaining **"Require Further Research"** items (these are addressed during the Prepare phase of implementation)
   - Explain that after approval, they can run `/PACT:orchestrate` to implement

**Do NOT exit plan mode** while "Require User Decision" items remain unresolved.

**Do NOT proceed to implementation** -- await user approval or feedback.

---

## When to Recommend Alternative Commands

If during Phase 0 analysis you determine:

- **Task is trivial** (typo, config change, single-line fix) -> Recommend `/PACT:comPACT` instead
- **Task is unclear** -> Ask clarifying questions before proceeding with planning
- **Task requires immediate research first** -> Recommend running preparation phase alone first

---

## Integration with /PACT:orchestrate

After the user approves the plan:

1. User runs `/PACT:orchestrate {same task}`
2. Orchestrator should check for existing plan in `docs/plans/`
3. If plan exists, use it as the implementation specification
4. Specialists receive relevant sections of the plan as context

**Task Linkage**: When `/PACT:orchestrate` runs, it checks for a completed Planning task matching the feature. If found, the plan artifact path from `metadata.artifact` is used to locate and reference the approved plan automatically.
