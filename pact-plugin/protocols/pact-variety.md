## Variety Management

Variety = complexity that must be matched with response capacity. Assess task variety before choosing a workflow.

### Task Variety Dimensions

| Dimension | 1 (Low) | 2 (Medium) | 3 (High) | 4 (Extreme) |
|-----------|---------|------------|----------|-------------|
| **Novelty** | Routine (done before) | Familiar (similar to past) | Novel (new territory) | Unprecedented |
| **Scope** | Single concern | Few concerns | Many concerns | Cross-cutting |
| **Uncertainty** | Clear requirements | Mostly clear | Ambiguous | Unknown |
| **Risk** | Low impact if wrong | Medium impact | High impact | Critical |

### Quick Variety Score

Score each dimension 1-4 and sum:

| Score | Variety Level | Recommended Workflow |
|-------|---------------|---------------------|
| **4-6** | Low | `/PACT:comPACT` |
| **7-10** | Medium | `/PACT:orchestrate` |
| **11-14** | High | `/PACT:plan-mode` → `/PACT:orchestrate` |
| **15-16** | Extreme | Research spike → Reassess |

**Calibration Examples**:

| Task | Novelty | Scope | Uncertainty | Risk | Score | Workflow |
|------|---------|-------|-------------|------|-------|----------|
| "Add pagination to existing list endpoint" | 1 | 1 | 1 | 2 | **5** | comPACT |
| "Add new CRUD endpoints following existing patterns" | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | **6** | comPACT |
| "Implement OAuth with new identity provider" | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | **12** | plan-mode → orchestrate |
| "Build real-time collaboration feature" | 4 | 4 | 3 | 3 | **14** | plan-mode → orchestrate |
| "Rewrite auth system with unfamiliar framework" | 4 | 4 | 4 | 4 | **16** | Research spike → Reassess |

> **Extreme (15-16) means**: Too much variety to absorb safely. The recommended action is a **research spike** (time-boxed exploration to reduce uncertainty) followed by reassessment. After the spike, the task should score lower—if it still scores 15+, decompose further or reconsider feasibility.

### Variety Strategies

**Attenuate** (reduce incoming variety):
- Apply existing patterns/templates from codebase
- Decompose into smaller, well-scoped sub-tasks
- Constrain to well-understood territory
- Use standards to reduce decision space

**Amplify** (increase response capacity):
- Invoke additional specialists
- Enable parallel execution (primary CODE phase strategy; use QDCL from orchestrate.md)
- Invoke nested PACT (`/PACT:rePACT`) for complex sub-components
- Run PREPARE phase to build understanding
- Apply risk-tiered testing (CRITICAL/HIGH) for high-risk areas

### Variety Checkpoints

At phase transitions, briefly assess:
- "Has variety increased?" → Consider amplifying (more specialists, nested PACT)
- "Has variety decreased?" → Consider simplifying (skip phases, fewer agents)
- "Are we matched?" → Continue as planned

**Who performs checkpoints**: Lead, at S4 mode transitions (between phases).
