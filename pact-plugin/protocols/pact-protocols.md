## S5 Policy Layer (Governance)

The policy layer defines non-negotiable constraints and provides escalation authority. All other protocols operate within these boundaries.

### Non-Negotiables (SACROSANCT)

These rules are **never** overridden by operational pressure:

| Category | Rule | Rationale |
|----------|------|-----------|
| **Security** | No credentials in code; validate all inputs; sanitize outputs | Prevents breaches, injection attacks |
| **Quality** | No known-broken code merged; tests must pass | Maintains system integrity |
| **Ethics** | No deceptive outputs; no harmful content | Aligns with responsible AI principles |
| **Delegation** | Orchestrator never writes application code | Maintains role boundaries |
| **User Approval** | Never merge PRs without explicit user authorization | User controls their codebase |

**If a rule would be violated**: Stop work, report to user. These are not trade-offs—they are boundaries.

### Delegation Enforcement

**Application code** (orchestrator must delegate):
- Source files (`.py`, `.ts`, `.js`, `.rb`, `.go`, etc.)
- Test files (`.spec.ts`, `.test.js`, `test_*.py`)
- Scripts (`.sh`, `Makefile`, `Dockerfile`)
- Infrastructure (`.tf`, `.yaml`, `.yml`)
- App config (`.env`, `.json`, `config/`)

**Not application code** (orchestrator may edit):
- AI tooling (`CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/`)
- Documentation (`docs/`)
- Git config (`.gitignore`)
- IDE settings (`.vscode/`, `.idea/`)

**Tool Checkpoint**: Before `Edit`/`Write`:
1. STOP — Is this application code?
2. Yes → Delegate | No → Proceed | Uncertain → Delegate

**Recovery Protocol** (if you catch yourself mid-violation):
1. Stop immediately
2. Revert uncommitted changes (`git checkout -- <file>`)
3. Delegate to appropriate specialist
4. Note the near-violation for learning

**Why delegation matters**:
- **Role integrity**: Orchestrators coordinate; specialists implement
- **Accountability**: Clear ownership of code changes
- **Quality**: Specialists apply domain expertise
- **Auditability**: Clean separation of concerns

### Policy Checkpoints

At defined points, verify alignment with project principles:

| Checkpoint | When | Question |
|------------|------|----------|
| **Pre-CODE** | Before CODE phase begins | "Does the architecture align with project principles?" |
| **Pre-Edit** | Before using Edit/Write tools | "Is this application code? If yes, delegate." |
| **Pre-PR** | Before creating PR | "Does this maintain system integrity? Are tests passing?" |
| **Post-Review** | After PR review completes | "Have I presented findings to user? Am I waiting for their merge decision?" |
| **On Conflict** | When specialists disagree | "What do project values dictate?" |
| **On Blocker** | When normal flow can't proceed | "Is this an operational issue (imPACT) or viability threat (escalate to user)?" |

### S5 Authority

The **user is ultimate S5**. When conflicts cannot be resolved at lower levels:
- S3/S4 tension (execution vs adaptation) → Escalate to user
- Principle conflicts → Escalate to user
- Unclear non-negotiable boundaries → Escalate to user

The orchestrator has authority to make operational decisions within policy. It does not have authority to override policy.

### Merge Authorization Boundary

**Never merge or close PRs without explicit user approval.** Present review findings, state merge readiness, then stop and wait. "All reviewers approved" ≠ user authorized merge.

### S5 Decision Framing Protocol

When escalating any decision to user, apply variety attenuation to present decision-ready options rather than raw information.

#### Framing Template

```
{ICON} {DECISION_TYPE}: {One-line summary}

**Context**: [2-3 sentences max — what happened, why escalation needed]

**Options**:
A) {Option label}
   - Action: [What happens]
   - Trade-off: [Gain vs cost]

B) {Option label}
   - Action: [What happens]
   - Trade-off: [Gain vs cost]

C) Other (specify)

**Recommendation**: {Option} — [Brief rationale if you have a recommendation]
```

#### Decision Types and Icons

| Type | Icon | When |
|------|------|------|
| S3/S4 Tension | ⚖️ | Operational vs strategic conflict |
| Scope Change | 📐 | Task boundaries shifting |
| Technical Choice | 🔧 | Multiple valid approaches |
| Risk Assessment | ⚠️ | Uncertainty requiring judgment |
| Principle Conflict | 🎯 | Values in tension |
| Algedonic (HALT) | 🛑 | Viability threat — stops work |
| Algedonic (ALERT) | ⚡ | Attention needed — pauses work |

#### Example: Good Framing

> ⚖️ **S3/S4 Tension**: Skip PREPARE phase for faster delivery?
>
> **Context**: Task appears routine based on description, but touches auth code which has been problematic before.
>
> **Options**:
> A) **Skip PREPARE** — Start coding now, handle issues as they arise
>    - Trade-off: Faster start, but may hit avoidable blockers
>
> B) **Run PREPARE** — Research auth patterns first (~30 min)
>    - Trade-off: Slower start, but informed approach
>
> **Recommendation**: B — Auth code has caused issues; small investment reduces risk.

#### Example: Poor Framing (Avoid)

> "I'm not sure whether to skip the prepare phase. On one hand we could save time but on the other hand there might be issues. The auth code has been problematic. What do you think we should do? Also there are some other considerations like..."

#### Attenuation Guidelines

1. **Limit options to 2-3** — More creates decision paralysis
2. **Lead with recommendation** if you have one
3. **Quantify when possible** — "~30 min" beats "some time"
4. **State trade-offs explicitly** — Don't hide costs
5. **Keep context brief** — User can ask for more

## S4 Checkpoint Protocol

At phase boundaries, the orchestrator performs an S4 checkpoint to assess whether the current approach remains valid.

> **Temporal Horizon**: S4 operates at a **days** horizon—asking questions about the current milestone or sprint, not minute-level implementation details. See [CLAUDE.md > Temporal Horizons](../CLAUDE.md) for the full horizon model.

### Trigger Points

- After PREPARE phase completes
- After ARCHITECT phase completes
- After CODE phase completes (before TEST)
- When any agent reports unexpected complexity
- On user-initiated "pause and assess"

### Checkpoint Questions

1. **Environment Change**: Has external context shifted?
   - New requirements discovered?
   - Constraints invalidated?
   - Dependencies changed?

2. **Model Divergence**: Does our understanding match reality?
   - Assumptions proven wrong?
   - Estimates significantly off?
   - Risks materialized or emerged?

3. **Plan Viability**: Is current approach still optimal?
   - Should we continue as planned?
   - Adapt the approach?
   - Escalate to user for direction?

### Checkpoint Outcomes

| Finding | Action |
|---------|--------|
| All clear | Continue to next phase |
| Minor drift | Note in handoff, continue |
| Significant change | Pause, assess, may re-run prior phase |
| Fundamental shift | Escalate to user (S5) |

### Checkpoint Format (Brief)

> **S4 Checkpoint** [Phase→Phase]:
> - Environment: [stable / shifted: {what}]
> - Model: [aligned / diverged: {what}]
> - Plan: [viable / adapt: {how} / escalate: {why}]

### Output Behavior

**Default**: Silent-unless-issue — checkpoint runs internally; only surfaces to user when drift or issues detected.

**Examples**:

*Silent (all clear)*:
> (Internal) S4 Checkpoint Post-PREPARE: Environment stable, model aligned, plan viable → continue

*Surfaces to user (issue detected)*:
> **S4 Checkpoint** [PREPARE→ARCHITECT]:
> - Environment: Shifted — API v2 deprecated, v3 has breaking changes
> - Model: Diverged — Assumed backwards compatibility, now false
> - Plan: Adapt — Need PREPARE extension to research v3 migration path

### Relationship to Variety Checkpoints

S4 Checkpoints complement Variety Checkpoints (see Variety Management):
- **Variety Checkpoints**: "Do we have enough response capacity for this complexity?"
- **S4 Checkpoints**: "Is our understanding of the situation still valid?"

Both occur at phase transitions but ask different questions.

---

## S4 Environment Model

S4 checkpoints assess whether our mental model matches reality. The **Environment Model** makes this model explicit—documenting assumptions, constraints, and context that inform decision-making.

### Purpose

- **Make implicit assumptions explicit** — What do we assume about the tech stack, APIs, constraints?
- **Enable divergence detection** — When reality contradicts the model, we notice faster
- **Provide checkpoint reference** — S4 checkpoints compare current state against this baseline

### When to Create

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Start of PREPARE phase | Create initial environment model |
| High-variety tasks (11+) | Required — model complexity demands explicit tracking |
| Medium-variety tasks (7-10) | Recommended — document key assumptions |
| Low-variety tasks (4-6) | Optional — implicit model often sufficient |

### Model Contents

```markdown
# Environment Model: {Feature/Project}

## Tech Stack Assumptions
- Language: {language/version}
- Framework: {framework/version}
- Key dependencies: {list with version expectations}

## External Dependencies
- APIs: {list with version/availability assumptions}
- Services: {list with status assumptions}
- Data sources: {list with schema/format assumptions}

## Constraints
- Performance: {expected loads, latency requirements}
- Security: {compliance requirements, auth constraints}
- Time: {deadlines, phase durations}
- Resources: {team capacity, compute limits}

## Unknowns (Acknowledged Gaps)
- {List areas of uncertainty}
- {Questions that need answers}
- {Risks that need monitoring}

## Invalidation Triggers
- If {assumption X} proves false → {response}
- If {constraint Y} changes → {response}
```

### Location

`docs/preparation/environment-model-{feature}.md`

Created during PREPARE phase, referenced during S4 checkpoints.

### Update Protocol

| Event | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Assumption invalidated | Update model, note in S4 checkpoint |
| New constraint discovered | Add to model, assess impact |
| Unknown resolved | Move from Unknowns to appropriate section |
| Model significantly outdated | Consider returning to PREPARE |

### Relationship to S4 Checkpoints

The Environment Model is the baseline against which S4 checkpoints assess:
- "Environment shifted" → Compare current state to Environment Model
- "Model diverged" → Assumptions in model no longer hold
- "Plan viable" → Constraints in model still valid for current approach

---

## S3/S4 Tension Detection and Resolution

S3 (operational control) and S4 (strategic intelligence) are in constant tension. This is healthy—but unrecognized tension leads to poor decisions.

### Tension Indicators

S3/S4 tension exists when:
- **Schedule vs Quality**: Pressure to skip phases vs need for thorough work
- **Execute vs Investigate**: Urge to code vs need to understand
- **Commit vs Adapt**: Investment in current approach vs signals to change
- **Efficiency vs Safety**: Speed of parallel execution vs coordination overhead

### Detection Phrases

When you find yourself thinking:
- "We're behind, let's skip PREPARE" → S3 pushing
- "Requirements seem unclear, we should dig deeper" → S4 pulling
- "Let's just code it and see" → S3 shortcutting
- "This feels risky, we should plan more" → S4 cautioning

### Resolution Protocol

1. **Name the tension explicitly**:
   > "S3/S4 tension detected: [specific tension]"

2. **Articulate trade-offs**:
   > "S3 path: [action] — gains: [X], risks: [Y]"
   > "S4 path: [action] — gains: [X], risks: [Y]"

3. **Assess against project values**:
   - Does CLAUDE.md favor speed or quality for this project?
   - Is this a high-risk area requiring caution?
   - What has the user expressed preference for?

4. **If resolution is clear**: Decide and document
5. **If resolution is unclear**: Escalate to user (S5)

### Escalation Format

When escalating S3/S4 tension to user, use S5 Decision Framing:

> ⚖️ **S3/S4 Tension**: {One-line summary}
>
> **Context**: [What's happening, why tension exists]
>
> **Option A (S3 — Operational)**: [Action]
> - Gains: [Benefits]
> - Risks: [Costs]
>
> **Option B (S4 — Strategic)**: [Action]
> - Gains: [Benefits]
> - Risks: [Costs]
>
> **Recommendation**: [If you have one, with rationale]

### Integration with S4 Checkpoints

S4 Checkpoints are natural points to assess S3/S4 tension:
- Checkpoint finds drift → S3 wants to continue, S4 wants to adapt → Tension
- Checkpoint finds all-clear but behind schedule → S3 wants to skip phases, S4 wants thoroughness → Tension

When a checkpoint surfaces tension, apply the Resolution Protocol above.

## S2 Coordination Layer

The coordination layer enables parallel agent operation without conflicts. S2 is **proactive** (prevents conflicts) not just **reactive** (resolves conflicts). Apply these protocols whenever multiple agents work concurrently.

### Task System Integration

With PACT Task integration, the TaskList serves as a **shared state mechanism** for coordination:

| Use Case | How TaskList Helps |
|----------|-------------------|
| **Conflict detection** | Query TaskList to see what files/components other agents are working on |
| **Parallel agent visibility** | All in_progress agent Tasks visible via TaskList |
| **Convention propagation** | First agent's metadata (decisions, patterns) queryable by later agents |
| **Resource claims** | Agent Tasks can include metadata about claimed resources |

**Coordination via Tasks:**
```
Before parallel dispatch:
1. TaskList → check for in_progress agents on same files
2. If conflict detected → sequence or assign boundaries
3. Dispatch agents with Task IDs
4. Monitor via TaskList for completion/blockers
```

### Information Flows

S2 manages information flow between agents:

| From | To | Information |
|------|-----|-------------|
| Earlier agent | Later agents | Conventions established, interfaces defined |
| Orchestrator | All agents | Shared context, boundary assignments |
| Any agent | Orchestrator → All others | Resource claims, conflict warnings |
| TaskList | All agents | Current in_progress work, blockers, completed decisions |

### Pre-Parallel Coordination Check

Before invoking parallel agents, the orchestrator must:

1. **Identify potential conflicts**:
   - Shared files (merge conflict risk)
   - Shared interfaces (API contract disagreements)
   - Shared state (database schemas, config, environment)

2. **Define boundaries or sequencing**:
   - If conflicts exist, either sequence the work or assign clear file/component boundaries
   - If no conflicts, proceed with parallel invocation

3. **Establish resolution authority**:
   - Technical disagreements → Architect arbitrates
   - Style/convention disagreements → First agent's choice becomes standard
   - Resource contention → Orchestrator allocates

### S2 Pre-Parallel Checkpoint Format

When analyzing parallel work, emit proactive coordination signals:

> **S2 Pre-Parallel Check**:
> - Shared files: [none / list with mitigation]
> - Shared interfaces: [none / contract defined by X]
> - Conventions: [pre-defined / first agent establishes]
> - Anticipated conflicts: [none / sequencing X before Y]

**Example**:
> **S2 Pre-Parallel Check**:
> - Shared files: `src/types/api.ts` — Backend defines, Frontend consumes (read-only)
> - Shared interfaces: API contract defined in architecture doc
> - Conventions: Follow existing patterns in `src/utils/`
> - Anticipated conflicts: None

### Conflict Resolution

| Conflict Type | Resolution |
|---------------|------------|
| Same file | Sequence agents OR assign clear section boundaries |
| Interface disagreement | Architect arbitrates; document decision |
| Naming/convention | First agent's choice becomes standard for the batch |
| Resource contention | Orchestrator allocates; others wait or work on different tasks |

### Convention Propagation

When "first agent's choice becomes standard," subsequent agents need to discover those conventions:

1. **Orchestrator responsibility**: When invoking parallel agents after the first completes:
   - Extract key conventions from first agent's output (naming patterns, file structure, API style)
   - Include in subsequent agents' prompts: "Follow conventions established: {list}"

2. **Handoff reference**: Orchestrator passes first agent's key decisions to subsequent agents

3. **For truly parallel invocation** (all start simultaneously):
   - Orchestrator pre-defines conventions in all prompts
   - Or: Run one agent first to establish conventions, then invoke the rest concurrently
   - **Tie-breaker**: If agents complete simultaneously and no first-agent convention exists, use alphabetical domain order (backend, database, frontend) for convention precedence

### Shared Language

All agents operating in parallel must:
- Use project glossary and established terminology
- Use standardized handoff structure (see Phase Handoffs)

### Parallelization Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Problem | Fix |
|--------------|---------|-----|
| **Sequential by default** | Missed parallelization opportunity | Run QDCL; require justification for sequential |
| **Ignoring shared files** | Merge conflicts; wasted work | QDCL catches this; sequence or assign boundaries |
| **Over-parallelization** | Coordination overhead; convention drift | Limit parallel agents; use S2 coordination |
| **Analysis paralysis** | QDCL takes longer than the work | Time-box to 1 minute; default to parallel if unclear |
| **Single agent for batch** | 4 bugs → 1 coder instead of 2-4 coders | **4+ items = multiple agents** (no exceptions) |
| **"Simpler to track" rationalization** | Sounds reasonable, wastes time | Not a valid justification; invoke concurrently anyway |
| **"Related tasks" conflation** | "Related" ≠ "dependent"; false equivalence | Related is NOT blocked; only file/data dependencies block |
| **"One agent can handle it" excuse** | Can ≠ should; missed efficiency | Capability is not justification for sequential |

**Recovery**: If in doubt, default to parallel with S2 coordination active. Conflicts are recoverable; lost time is not.

### Rationalization Detection

When you find yourself thinking these thoughts, STOP—you're rationalizing sequential dispatch:

| Thought | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "They're small tasks" | Small = cheap to invoke together. Split. |
| "Coordination overhead" | QDCL takes 30 seconds. Split. |

**Valid reasons to sequence** (cite explicitly when choosing sequential):
- "File X is modified by both" → Sequence or define boundaries
- "A's output feeds B's input" → Sequence them
- "Shared interface undefined" → Define interface first, then parallel

### Anti-Oscillation Protocol

If agents produce contradictory outputs (each "fixing" the other's work):

1. **Detect**: Outputs conflict OR agents undo each other's work
2. **Pause**: Stop both agents immediately
3. **Diagnose**: Root cause—technical disagreement or requirements ambiguity?
4. **Resolve**:
   - Technical disagreement → Architect arbitrates
   - Requirements ambiguity → User (S5) clarifies
5. **Document**: Note resolution in handoff for future reference
6. **Resume**: Only after documented resolution

**Detection Signals**:
- Agent A modifies what Agent B just created
- Both agents claim ownership of same interface
- Output contradicts established convention
- Repeated "fix" cycles in same file/component

**Heuristic**: Consider it oscillation if the same file is modified by different agents 2+ times in rapid succession.

### Routine Information Sharing

After each specialist completes work:
1. **Extract** key decisions, conventions, interfaces established
2. **Propagate** to subsequent agents in their prompts
3. **Update** shared context for any agents still running in parallel

This transforms implicit knowledge into explicit coordination, reducing "surprise" conflicts.

---

## S1 Autonomy & Recursion

Specialists (S1) have bounded autonomy to adapt within their domain. This section defines those boundaries and enables recursive PACT cycles for complex sub-tasks.

### Autonomy Charter

All specialists have authority to:
- **Adjust implementation approach** based on discoveries during work
- **Request context** from other specialists via the orchestrator
- **Recommend scope changes** when task complexity differs from estimate
- **Apply domain expertise** without micro-management from orchestrator

All specialists must escalate when:
- **Discovery contradicts architecture** — findings invalidate the design
- **Scope change exceeds 20%** — significantly more/less work than expected
- **Security/policy implications emerge** — potential S5 violations discovered
- **Cross-domain dependency** — need changes in another specialist's area

### Self-Coordination

When working in parallel (see S2 Coordination):
- Check S2 protocols before starting if multiple agents are active
- Respect assigned file/component boundaries
- First agent's conventions become standard for the batch
- Report potential conflicts to orchestrator immediately

### Recursive PACT (Nested Cycles)

When a sub-task is complex enough to warrant its own PACT treatment:

**Recognition Indicators:**
- Sub-task spans multiple concerns within your domain
- Sub-task has its own uncertainty requiring research
- Sub-task output feeds multiple downstream consumers
- Sub-task could benefit from its own prepare/architect/code/test cycle

**Protocol:**
1. **Declare**: "Invoking nested PACT for {sub-task}"
2. **Execute**: Run mini-PACT cycle (may skip phases if not needed)
3. **Integrate**: Merge results back to parent task
4. **Report**: Include nested work in handoff to orchestrator

**Constraints:**
- **Nesting limit**: 1 level maximum (prevent infinite recursion)
- **Scope check**: Nested PACT must be within your domain; cross-domain needs escalate to orchestrator
- **Documentation**: Nested cycles report via handoff to parent
- **Algedonic signals**: Algedonic signals from nested cycles still go **directly to user**—they bypass both the nested orchestration AND the parent orchestrator. Viability threats don't wait for hierarchy.

**Example:**
```
Parent task: "Implement user authentication service"
Nested PACT: "Research and implement OAuth2 token refresh mechanism"
  - Mini-Prepare: Research OAuth2 refresh token best practices
  - Mini-Architect: Design token storage and refresh flow
  - Mini-Code: Implement the mechanism
  - Mini-Test: Smoke test the refresh flow
```

### Orchestrator-Initiated Recursion (/PACT:rePACT)

While specialists can invoke nested cycles autonomously, the orchestrator can also initiate them:

| Initiator | Mechanism | When |
|-----------|-----------|------|
| Specialist | Autonomy Charter | Discovers complexity during work |
| Orchestrator | `/PACT:rePACT` command | Identifies complex sub-task upfront |

**Usage:**
- Single-domain: `/PACT:rePACT backend "implement rate limiting"`
- Multi-domain: `/PACT:rePACT "implement audit logging sub-system"`

See [rePACT.md](../commands/rePACT.md) for full command documentation.

---

## Algedonic Signals (Emergency Bypass)

Algedonic signals handle viability-threatening conditions that require immediate user attention. Unlike normal blockers (handled by imPACT), algedonic signals bypass normal orchestration flow.

> **VSM Context**: In Beer's VSM, algedonic signals are "pain/pleasure" signals that bypass management hierarchy to reach policy level (S5) instantly.

For full protocol details, see [algedonic.md](algedonic.md).

### Quick Reference

| Level | Categories | Response |
|-------|------------|----------|
| **HALT** | SECURITY, DATA, ETHICS | All work stops; user must acknowledge |
| **ALERT** | QUALITY, SCOPE, META-BLOCK | Work pauses; user decides |

### Signal Format

```
⚠️ ALGEDONIC [HALT|ALERT]: {Category}

**Issue**: {One-line description}
**Evidence**: {What triggered this}
**Impact**: {Why this threatens viability}
**Recommended Action**: {Suggested response}
```

### Key Rules

- **Any agent** can emit algedonic signals when they recognize trigger conditions
- Orchestrator **MUST** surface signals to user immediately—cannot suppress or delay
- HALT requires user acknowledgment before ANY work resumes
- ALERT allows user to choose: Investigate / Continue / Stop

### Relationship to imPACT

| Situation | Protocol | Scope |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| Operational blocker | imPACT | "How do we proceed?" |
| Repeated blocker (3+ cycles) | imPACT → ALERT | Escalate to user |
| Viability threat | Algedonic | "Should we proceed at all?" |

---

## Variety Management

Variety = complexity that must be matched with response capacity. Assess task variety before choosing a workflow.

### Task Variety Dimensions

| Dimension | 1 (Low) | 2 (Medium) | 3 (High) | 4 (Extreme) |
|-----------|---------|------------|----------|-------------|
| **Novelty** | Routine (done before) | Familiar (similar to past) | Novel (new territory) | Unprecedented |
| **Scope** | Single concern | Few concerns | Many concerns | Cross-cutting |
| **Uncertainty** | Clear requirements | Mostly clear | Ambiguous | Unknown |
| **Risk** | Low impact if wrong | Medium impact | High impact | Critical |

### Quick Variety Score

Score each dimension 1-4 and sum:

| Score | Variety Level | Recommended Workflow |
|-------|---------------|---------------------|
| **4-6** | Low | `/PACT:comPACT` |
| **7-10** | Medium | `/PACT:orchestrate` |
| **11-14** | High | `/PACT:plan-mode` → `/PACT:orchestrate` |
| **15-16** | Extreme | Research spike → Reassess |

**Calibration Examples**:

| Task | Novelty | Scope | Uncertainty | Risk | Score | Workflow |
|------|---------|-------|-------------|------|-------|----------|
| "Add pagination to existing list endpoint" | 1 | 1 | 1 | 2 | **5** | comPACT |
| "Add new CRUD endpoints following existing patterns" | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | **6** | comPACT |
| "Implement OAuth with new identity provider" | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | **12** | plan-mode → orchestrate |
| "Build real-time collaboration feature" | 4 | 4 | 3 | 3 | **14** | plan-mode → orchestrate |
| "Rewrite auth system with unfamiliar framework" | 4 | 4 | 4 | 4 | **16** | Research spike → Reassess |

> **Extreme (15-16) means**: Too much variety to absorb safely. The recommended action is a **research spike** (time-boxed exploration to reduce uncertainty) followed by reassessment. After the spike, the task should score lower—if it still scores 15+, decompose further or reconsider feasibility.

### Variety Strategies

**Attenuate** (reduce incoming variety):
- Apply existing patterns/templates from codebase
- Decompose into smaller, well-scoped sub-tasks
- Constrain to well-understood territory
- Use standards to reduce decision space

**Amplify** (increase response capacity):
- Invoke additional specialists
- Enable parallel execution (primary CODE phase strategy; use QDCL from orchestrate.md)
- Invoke nested PACT (`/PACT:rePACT`) for complex sub-components
- Run PREPARE phase to build understanding
- Apply risk-tiered testing (CRITICAL/HIGH) for high-risk areas

### Variety Checkpoints

At phase transitions, briefly assess:
- "Has variety increased?" → Consider amplifying (more specialists, nested PACT)
- "Has variety decreased?" → Consider simplifying (skip phases, fewer agents)
- "Are we matched?" → Continue as planned

**Who performs checkpoints**: Orchestrator, at S4 mode transitions (between phases).

## The PACT Workflow Family

| Workflow | When to Use | Key Idea |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **PACT** | Complex/greenfield work | Context-aware multi-agent orchestration |
| **plan-mode** | Before complex work, need alignment | Multi-agent planning consultation, no implementation |
| **comPACT** | Focused, single-domain tasks | Single-domain delegation with light ceremony (parallelizable) |
| **rePACT** | Complex sub-tasks within orchestration | Recursive nested P→A→C→T cycle (single or multi-domain) |
| **imPACT** | When blocked or need to iterate | Triage: Redo prior phase? Additional agents needed? |

---

## plan-mode Protocol

**Purpose**: Multi-agent planning consultation before implementation. Get specialist perspectives synthesized into an actionable plan.

**When to use**:
- Complex features where upfront alignment prevents rework
- Tasks spanning multiple specialist domains
- When you want user approval before implementation begins
- Greenfield work with significant architectural decisions

**Four phases**:

| Phase | What Happens |
|-------|--------------|
| 0. Analyze | Orchestrator assesses scope, selects relevant specialists |
| 1. Consult | Specialists provide planning perspectives in parallel |
| 2. Synthesize | Orchestrator resolves conflicts, sequences work, assesses risk |
| 3. Present | Save plan to `docs/plans/`, present to user, await approval |

**Key rules**:
- **No implementation** — planning consultation only
- **No git branch** — that happens when `/PACT:orchestrate` runs
- Specialists operate in "planning-only mode" (analysis, not action)
- Conflicts surfaced and resolved (or flagged for user decision)

**Output**: `docs/plans/{feature-slug}-plan.md`

**After approval**: User runs `/PACT:orchestrate {task}`, which references the plan.

**When to recommend alternatives**:
- Trivial task → `/PACT:comPACT`
- Unclear requirements → Ask clarifying questions first
- Need research before planning → Run preparation phase alone first

---

## imPACT Protocol

**Trigger when**: Blocked; get similar errors repeatedly; or prior phase output is wrong.

**Two questions**:
1. **Redo prior phase?** — Is the issue upstream in P→A→C→T?
2. **Additional agents needed?** — Do I need subagents to assist?

**Three outcomes**:
| Outcome | When | Action |
|---------|------|--------|
| Redo solo | Prior phase broken, I can fix it | Loop back and fix yourself |
| Redo with help | Prior phase broken, need specialist | Loop back with subagent assistance |
| Proceed with help | Current phase correct, blocked on execution | Invoke subagents to help forward |

If neither question is "Yes," you're not blocked—continue.

---

## comPACT Protocol

**Core idea**: Single-DOMAIN delegation with light ceremony.

comPACT handles tasks within ONE specialist domain. For independent sub-tasks, it can invoke MULTIPLE specialists of the same type in parallel.

**Available specialists**:
| Shorthand | Specialist | Use For |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| `backend` | pact-backend-coder | Server-side logic, APIs, middleware |
| `frontend` | pact-frontend-coder | UI, React, client-side |
| `database` | pact-database-engineer | Schema, queries, migrations |
| `prepare` | pact-preparer | Research, requirements |
| `test` | pact-test-engineer | Standalone test tasks |
| `architect` | pact-architect | Design guidance, pattern selection |

**Smart specialist selection**:
- *Clear task* → Auto-select (domain keywords, file types, single-domain action)
- *Ambiguous task* → Ask user which specialist

### When to Invoke Multiple Specialists

**MANDATORY: parallel unless tasks share files.** comPACT invokes multiple agents of the same type for independent items.

Invoke multiple specialists of the same type when:
- Multiple independent items (bugs, components, endpoints)
- No shared files between sub-tasks
- Same patterns/conventions apply to all

| Task | Agents Invoked |
|------|----------------|
| "Fix 3 backend bugs" | 3 backend-coders (parallel) |
| "Add validation to 5 endpoints" | Multiple backend-coders (parallel) |
| "Update styling on 3 components" | Multiple frontend-coders (parallel) |

### Pre-Invocation (Required)

1. **Set up worktree** — If already in a worktree for this feature, reuse it. Otherwise, invoke `/PACT:worktree-setup` with the feature branch name. All subsequent work happens in the worktree.
2. **Verify session team exists** — The `{team_name}` team should already exist from session start. If not, create it now: `TeamCreate(team_name="{team_name}")`.
3. **S2 coordination** (if concurrent) — Check for file conflicts, assign boundaries

### S2 Light Coordination (for parallel comPACT)

1. **Check for conflicts** — Do any sub-tasks touch the same files?
2. **Assign boundaries** — If conflicts exist, sequence or define clear boundaries
3. **Set convention authority** — First agent's choices become standard for the batch

### Light ceremony instructions (injected when invoking specialist)

- Work directly from task description
- Check docs/plans/, docs/preparation/, docs/architecture/ briefly if they exist—reference relevant context
- Do not create new documentation artifacts
- Smoke tests only: Verify it compiles, runs, and happy path doesn't crash (no comprehensive unit tests—that's TEST phase work)

**Escalate to `/PACT:orchestrate` when**:
- Task spans multiple specialist domains
- Complex cross-domain coordination needed
- Specialist reports a blocker (run `/PACT:imPACT` first)

### After Specialist Completes

1. **Receive handoff** from specialist(s)
2. **Run tests** — verify work passes. If tests fail → return to specialist for fixes before committing.
3. **Create atomic commit(s)** — stage and commit before proceeding

**Next steps** — After commit, ask: "Work committed. Create PR?"
- Yes (Recommended) → invoke `/PACT:peer-review`
- Not yet → worktree persists; user resumes later. Clean up manually with `/PACT:worktree-cleanup` when done.
- More work → continue with comPACT or orchestrate

**If blocker reported**:
1. Receive blocker from specialist
2. Run `/PACT:imPACT` to triage
3. May escalate to `/PACT:orchestrate` if task exceeds single-specialist scope

---

## Phase Handoffs

**On completing any phase, state**:
1. What you produced (with file paths)
2. Key decisions made
3. What the next agent needs to know

Keep it brief. No templates required.

## Task Hierarchy

This document explains how PACT uses Claude Code's Task system to track work at multiple levels.

### Hierarchy Levels

```
Feature Task (created by orchestrator)
├── Phase Tasks (PREPARE, ARCHITECT, CODE, TEST)
│   ├── Agent Task 1 (specialist work)
│   ├── Agent Task 2 (parallel specialist)
│   └── Agent Task 3 (parallel specialist)
└── Review Task (peer-review phase)
```

### Task Ownership

| Level | Created By | Owned By | Lifecycle |
|-------|------------|----------|-----------|
| Feature | Orchestrator | Orchestrator | Spans entire workflow |
| Phase | Orchestrator | Orchestrator | Active during phase |
| Agent | Orchestrator | Specialist (self-managed) | Specialist claims via `TaskUpdate(status="in_progress")`, completes via `TaskUpdate(status="completed")` |

Under Agent Teams, specialists self-manage their agent task lifecycle. The orchestrator creates tasks via `TaskCreate` and assigns ownership, but the specialist teammate claims the task (sets `in_progress`) and marks it `completed` upon finishing. This differs from the background task model where the orchestrator managed all task state transitions.

### Task States

Tasks progress through: `pending` → `in_progress` → `completed`

- **pending**: Created but not started
- **in_progress**: Active work underway
- **completed**: Work finished (success or documented failure)

### Blocking Relationships

Use `addBlockedBy` to express dependencies:

```
CODE phase task
├── blockedBy: [ARCHITECT task ID]
└── Agent tasks within CODE
    └── blockedBy: [CODE phase task ID]
```

### Metadata Conventions

Agent tasks include metadata for context:

```json
{
  "phase": "CODE",
  "domain": "backend",
  "feature": "user-auth",
  "handoff": {
    "produced": ["src/auth.ts"],
    "uncertainty": ["token refresh edge cases"]
  }
}
```

### Scope-Aware Task Conventions

When decomposition creates sub-scopes, tasks use naming and metadata conventions to maintain scope ownership.

#### Naming Convention

Prefix task subjects with `[scope:{scope_id}]` to make TaskList output scannable:

```
[scope:backend-api] ARCHITECT: backend-api
[scope:backend-api] CODE: backend-api
[scope:frontend-ui] CODE: frontend-ui
```

Tasks without a scope prefix belong to the root (parent) orchestrator scope.

#### Scope Metadata

Include `scope_id` in task metadata to enable structured filtering:

```json
{
  "scope_id": "backend-api",
  "phase": "CODE",
  "domain": "backend"
}
```

The parent orchestrator iterates all tasks and filters by `scope_id` metadata to track per-scope progress. Claude Code's Task API does not support native scope filtering, so this convention-based approach is required.

#### Scoped Hierarchy

When decomposition occurs, the hierarchy extends with scope-level tasks:

```
Feature Task (root orchestrator)
├── PREPARE Phase Task (single scope, always)
├── ATOMIZE Phase Task (dispatches sub-scopes)
│   └── Scope Tasks (one per sub-scope)
│       ├── [scope:backend-api] Phase Tasks
│       │   └── [scope:backend-api] Agent Tasks
│       └── [scope:frontend-ui] Phase Tasks
│           └── [scope:frontend-ui] Agent Tasks
├── CONSOLIDATE Phase Task (cross-scope verification)
└── TEST Phase Task (comprehensive feature testing)
```

Scope tasks are created during the ATOMIZE phase. The CONSOLIDATE phase task is blocked by all scope task completions. TEST is blocked by CONSOLIDATE completion.

### Integration with PACT Signals

- **Algedonic signals**: Emit via task metadata or direct escalation
- **Variety signals**: Note in task metadata when complexity differs from estimate
- **Handoff**: Store structured handoff in task metadata on completion

### Example Flow

1. Orchestrator creates Feature task: "Implement user authentication" (parent container)
2. Orchestrator creates PREPARE phase task under the Feature task
3. Orchestrator dispatches pact-preparer with agent task (blocked by PREPARE phase task)
4. Preparer completes, updates task to completed with handoff metadata
5. Orchestrator marks PREPARE complete, creates ARCHITECT phase task
6. Orchestrator creates CODE phase task (blocked by ARCHITECT phase task)
7. Pattern continues through remaining phases

---

## Backend ↔ Database Boundary

**Sequence**: Database delivers schema → Backend implements ORM.

| Database Engineer Owns | Backend Engineer Owns |
|------------------------|----------------------|
| Schema design, DDL | ORM models |
| Migrations | Repository/DAL layer |
| Complex SQL queries | Application queries via ORM |
| Indexes | Connection pooling |

**Collaboration**: If Backend needs a complex query, ask Database. If Database needs to know access patterns, ask Backend.

---

## Test Engagement

| Test Type | Owner |
|-----------|-------|
| Smoke tests | Coders (minimal verification) |
| Unit tests | Test Engineer |
| Integration tests | Test Engineer |
| E2E tests | Test Engineer |

**Coders**: Your work isn't done until smoke tests pass. Smoke tests verify: "Does it compile? Does it run? Does the happy path not crash?" No comprehensive testing—that's TEST phase work.

**Test Engineer**: Engage after Code phase. You own ALL substantive testing: unit tests, integration, E2E, edge cases, adversarial testing. Target 80%+ meaningful coverage of critical paths.

### CODE → TEST Handoff

Coders provide handoff summaries to the orchestrator, who passes them to the test engineer.

**Handoff Format**:
```
1. Produced: Files created/modified
2. Key decisions: Decisions with rationale, assumptions that could be wrong
3. Areas of uncertainty (PRIORITIZED):
   - [HIGH] {description} — Why risky, suggested test focus
   - [MEDIUM] {description}
   - [LOW] {description}
4. Integration points: Other components touched
5. Open questions: Unresolved items
```

Note: Not all priority levels need to be present. Most handoffs have 1-3 uncertainty items total. If you have no uncertainties to flag, explicitly state "No areas of uncertainty flagged" to confirm you considered the question (rather than forgot or omitted it).

**Example**:
```
1. Produced: `src/auth/token-manager.ts`, `src/auth/token-manager.test.ts`
2. Key decisions: Used JWT with 15min expiry (assumed acceptable for this app)
3. Areas of uncertainty:
   - [HIGH] Token refresh race condition — concurrent requests may get stale tokens; test with parallel calls
   - [MEDIUM] Clock skew handling — assumed <5s drift; may fail with larger skew
4. Integration points: Modified `src/middleware/auth.ts` to use new manager
5. Open questions: Should refresh tokens be stored in httpOnly cookies?
```

**Uncertainty Prioritization**:
- **HIGH**: "This could break in production" — Test engineer MUST cover these
- **MEDIUM**: "I'm not 100% confident" — Test engineer should cover these
- **LOW**: "Edge case I thought of" — Test engineer uses discretion

**Test Engineer Response**:
- HIGH uncertainty areas require explicit test cases (mandatory)
- If skipping a flagged area, document the rationale
- Report findings using the Signal Output System (GREEN/YELLOW/RED)

**This is context, not prescription.** The test engineer decides *how* to test, but flagged HIGH uncertainty areas must be addressed.

---

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

Before completing any phase, consider:
- **Security**: Input validation, auth, data protection
- **Performance**: Query efficiency, caching
- **Accessibility**: WCAG, keyboard nav (frontend)
- **Observability**: Logging, error tracking

Not a checklist—just awareness.

---

## Architecture Review (Optional)

For complex features, before Code phase:
- Coders quickly validate architect's design is implementable
- Flag blockers early, not during implementation

Skip for simple features or when "just build it."

---

## Documentation Locations

| Phase | Output Location |
|-------|-----------------|
| Plan | `docs/plans/` |
| Prepare | `docs/preparation/` |
| Architect | `docs/architecture/` |

**Plan vs. Architecture artifacts**:
- **Plans** (`docs/plans/`): Pre-approval roadmaps created by `/PACT:plan-mode`. Created *before* implementation begins.
- **Architecture** (`docs/architecture/`): Formal specifications created by `pact-architect` *during* the Architect phase.

**No persistent logging for CODE/TEST phases.** Context passes via structured handoffs between agents. Git commits capture the audit trail.

---

## Session Continuity

If work spans sessions, update CLAUDE.md with:
- Current phase and task
- Blockers or open questions
- Next steps

---

## Agent Stall Detection

**Stalled indicators** (Agent Teams model):
- TeammateIdle event received but no completion message or blocker was sent via SendMessage
- Task status in TaskList shows `in_progress` but no SendMessage activity from the teammate
- Teammate process terminated without sending a completion message or blocker via SendMessage

Detection is event-driven: check at signal monitoring points (after dispatch, on TeammateIdle events, on SendMessage receipt). If a teammate goes idle without sending a completion message or blocker, treat as stalled immediately.

**Exception — pact-memory-agent**: Uses the background task model (`run_in_background=true`). Stall indicators for this agent are: background task returned but no output, or task running with no progress at monitoring checkpoints.

### Recovery Protocol

1. Check the teammate's TaskList status and any partial task metadata or SendMessage output for context on what happened
2. Mark the stalled agent task as `completed` with `metadata={"stalled": true, "reason": "{what happened}"}`
3. Assess: Is the work partially done? Can it be continued from where it stopped?
4. Create a new agent task and spawn a new teammate to retry or continue the work, passing any partial output as context
5. If stall persists after 1 retry, emit an **ALERT** algedonic signal (META-BLOCK category)

### Prevention

Include in agent prompts: "If you encounter an error that prevents completion, send a message via SendMessage describing what you completed and store a partial HANDOFF in task metadata rather than silently failing."

### Non-Happy-Path Task Termination

When an agent cannot complete normally (stall, failure, or unresolvable blocker), mark its task as `completed` with descriptive metadata:

Metadata: `{"stalled": true, "reason": "..."}` | `{"failed": true, "reason": "..."}` | `{"blocked": true, "blocker_task": "..."}`

**Convention**: All non-happy-path terminations use `completed` with metadata — no `failed` status exists. This preserves the `pending → in_progress → completed` lifecycle.

---

## Incompleteness Signals

> **Purpose**: Define the signals that indicate a plan section is NOT complete.
> Used by `plan-mode` (producer) to populate the Phase Requirements table,
> and by `orchestrate` (consumer) to verify phase-skip decisions.

A plan section may exist without being complete. Before skipping a phase, the orchestrator checks the corresponding plan section for these 6 incompleteness signals. **Any signal present means the phase should run.**

---

### Signal Definitions

| # | Signal | What to Look For | Example |
|---|--------|-------------------|---------|
| 1 | **Unchecked research items** | `- [ ]` checkboxes in "Research Needed" sections | `- [ ] Investigate OAuth2 library options` |
| 2 | **TBD values in decision tables** | Cells containing "TBD" in "Key Decisions" or similar tables | `| Auth strategy | TBD | TBD | Needs research |` |
| 3 | **Forward references** | Deferred work markers using the format `⚠️ Handled during {PHASE_NAME}` | `⚠️ Handled during PREPARE` |
| 4 | **Unchecked questions** | `- [ ]` checkboxes in "Questions to Resolve" sections | `- [ ] Which caching layer to use?` |
| 5 | **Empty or placeholder sections** | Template text still present, or sections with no substantive content | `{Description of architectural approach}` |
| 6 | **Unresolved open questions** | `- [ ]` checkboxes in "Open Questions > Require Further Research" | `- [ ] Performance impact of encryption at rest` |

### Detection Guidance

- **Signals 1, 4, 6**: Search for `- [ ]` within the relevant section. Checked items (`- [x]`) are resolved and do not count.
- **Signal 2**: Scan table cells for the literal string "TBD" (case-insensitive).
- **Signal 3**: Search for the exact prefix `⚠️ Handled during`. Informal variants ("deferred to", "will be addressed in") are non-standard but should also raise suspicion.
- **Signal 5**: Look for curly-brace placeholders (`{...}`) or sections containing only headings with no content beneath them.

### Usage

**In `plan-mode` (Phase 2 synthesis)**: Check each phase's plan section for these signals to populate the Phase Requirements table.

**In `orchestrate` (Context Assessment)**: Before skipping a phase, verify its plan section passes the completeness check — all 6 signals absent. Use skip reason `"plan_section_complete"` when the check passes.

---

## Scope Detection

> **Purpose**: Detect multi-scope tasks during orchestration so the orchestrator can propose
> decomposition before committing to a single-scope execution plan.
> Evaluated after PREPARE phase output is available, before ARCHITECT phase begins.

### Detection Heuristics

The orchestrator evaluates PREPARE output against these heuristic signals to determine whether a task warrants decomposition into sub-scopes.

| Signal | Strength | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| **Distinct domain boundaries** | Strong (2 pts) | Task touches 2+ independent domains, evidenced by separate service boundaries, technology stacks, or specialist areas identified in PREPARE output (e.g., backend API + frontend UI, or changes spanning `services/auth/` and `services/billing/`) |
| **Non-overlapping work areas** | Strong (2 pts) | PREPARE output describes work areas with no shared files or components between them — each area maps to a separate specialist domain |
| **High specialist count** | Supporting (1 pt) | Task would require 4+ specialists across different domains to implement |
| **Prior complexity flags** | Supporting (1 pt) | pact-memory retrieval shows previous multi-scope flags or complexity warnings for this area |

### Counter-Signals

Counter-signals argue against decomposition. Each counter-signal present reduces the detection score by 1 point. Counter-signals **demote confidence** — they do not veto decomposition outright.

| Counter-Signal | Reasoning |
|----------------|-----------|
| **Shared data models across domains** | Sub-scopes would need constant coordination on shared types — single scope is simpler |
| **Small total scope despite multiple domains** | A one-line API change + one-line frontend change does not warrant sub-scope overhead |

### Scoring Model

```
Score = sum(detected heuristic points) - count(counter-signals present)
```

- **Strong** signals contribute **2 points** each
- **Supporting** signals contribute **1 point** each
- **Counter-signals** reduce score by **1 point** each (floor of 0)
- **Decomposition threshold**: Score >= 3

The threshold and point values are tunable. Adjust based on observed false-positive and false-negative rates during canary workflows.

**Single sub-scope guard**: If detection fires but only identifies 1 sub-scope, fall back to single scope. Decomposition with 1 scope adds overhead with no benefit.

### Scoring Examples

| Scenario | Signals | Counter-Signals | Score | Result |
|----------|---------|-----------------|-------|--------|
| Backend + frontend task | Distinct domain boundaries (2) + High specialist count (1) | — | 3 | Threshold met — propose decomposition |
| Backend + frontend + DB migration, no shared models | Distinct domain boundaries (2) + Non-overlapping work areas (2) + High specialist count (1) | — | 5 | All strong signals fire — autonomous tier eligible |
| API change + UI tweak, shared types | Distinct domain boundaries (2) | Small total scope (-1) + Shared data models (-1) | 0 | Below threshold — single scope |

A score of 0 means counter-signals outweighed detection signals, not that no signals were observed. The orchestrator still noted the signals — they were simply insufficient to warrant decomposition.

### Activation Tiers

| Tier | Trigger | Behavior |
|------|---------|----------|
| **Manual** | User invokes `/rePACT` explicitly | Always available — bypasses detection entirely |
| **Confirmed** (default) | Score >= threshold | Orchestrator proposes decomposition via S5 decision framing; user confirms, rejects, or adjusts boundaries |
| **Autonomous** | ALL strong signals fire (Distinct domain boundaries + Non-overlapping work areas) AND no counter-signals AND autonomous mode enabled | Orchestrator auto-decomposes without user confirmation |

**Autonomous mode** is opt-in. Enable by adding to `CLAUDE.md`:

```markdown
autonomous-scope-detection: enabled
```

When autonomous mode is not enabled, all detection-triggered decomposition uses the Confirmed tier.

### Evaluation Timing

1. **PREPARE** phase runs in single scope (always — research output is needed to evaluate signals)
2. If PREPARE was skipped but an approved plan exists, evaluate the plan's Preparation section content against the same heuristics. If neither PREPARE output nor plan content is available, skip detection entirely (proceed single-scope).
3. Orchestrator evaluates PREPARE output (or plan content) against heuristics
4. Score **below threshold** → proceed with single-scope execution (today's default behavior)
5. Score **at or above threshold** → activate the appropriate tier (Confirmed or Autonomous)

### Bypass Rules

- **Ongoing sub-scope execution** does not re-evaluate detection (no recursive detection within sub-scopes). Scoped sub-scopes cannot themselves trigger scope detection -- this bypass rule is the primary architectural mechanism; the 1-level nesting limit (see S1 Autonomy & Recursion constraints) serves as the safety net.
- **comPACT** bypasses scope detection entirely — it is inherently single-domain
- **Manual `/rePACT`** bypasses detection — user has already decided to decompose

### Evaluation Response

When detection fires (score >= threshold), the orchestrator must present the result to the user using S5 Decision Framing.

#### S5 Confirmation Flow

Use this framing template to propose decomposition:

```
📐 Scope Change: Multi-scope task detected

Context: [What signals fired and why — e.g., "3 distinct domains identified
(backend API, frontend UI, database migration) with no shared files"]

Options:
A) Decompose into sub-scopes: [proposed scope boundaries]
   - Trade-off: Better isolation, parallel execution; overhead of scope coordination

B) Continue as single scope
   - Trade-off: Simpler coordination; risk of context overflow with large task

C) Adjust boundaries (specify)

Recommendation: [A or B with brief rationale]
```

#### User Response Mapping

| Response | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Confirmed (A) | Generate scope contracts (see [pact-scope-contract.md](pact-scope-contract.md)), then proceed to ATOMIZE phase, which dispatches `/PACT:rePACT` for each sub-scope |
| Rejected (B) | Continue single scope (today's behavior) |
| Adjusted (C) | Generate scope contracts with user's modified boundaries, then proceed to ATOMIZE phase, which dispatches `/PACT:rePACT` for each sub-scope |

#### Autonomous Tier

When **all** of the following conditions are true, skip user confirmation and proceed directly to decomposition:

1. ALL strong signals fire (not merely meeting the threshold)
2. NO counter-signals present
3. CLAUDE.md contains `autonomous-scope-detection: enabled`

**Output format**: `Scope detection: Multi-scope (autonomous) — decomposing into [scope list]`

> **Note**: Autonomous mode is opt-in and disabled by default. Users enable it in CLAUDE.md after trusting the heuristics through repeated Confirmed-tier usage.

### Post-Detection: Scope Contract Generation

When decomposition is confirmed (by user or autonomous tier), the orchestrator generates a scope contract for each identified sub-scope before invoking rePACT. See [pact-scope-contract.md](pact-scope-contract.md) for the contract format and generation process.

---

## Scope Contract

> **Purpose**: Define what a sub-scope promises to deliver to its parent orchestrator.
> Scope contracts are generated at decomposition time using PREPARE output and serve as
> the authoritative agreement between parent and sub-scope for deliverables and interfaces.

### Contract Format

Each sub-scope receives a scope contract with the following structure:

```
Scope Contract: {scope-name}

Identity:
  scope_id: {kebab-case identifier, e.g., "backend-api"}
  parent_scope: {parent scope_id or "root"}
  executor: {assigned at dispatch — currently rePACT}

Deliverables:
  - {Expected file paths or patterns this scope produces}
  - {Non-file artifacts: API endpoints, schemas, migrations, etc.}

Interfaces:
  exports:
    - {Types, endpoints, APIs this scope exposes to siblings}
  imports:
    - {What this scope expects from sibling scopes}

Constraints:
  shared_files: []  # Files this scope must NOT modify (owned by siblings)
  conventions: []   # Coding conventions to follow (from parent or prior scopes)
```

### Design Principles

- **Minimal contracts** (~5-10 lines per scope): The consolidate phase catches what the contract does not specify. Over-specifying front-loads context cost into the orchestrator.
- **Backend-agnostic**: The contract defines WHAT a scope delivers, not HOW. The same contract format works whether the executor is rePACT (today) or Agent Teams (future).
- **Generated, not authored**: The orchestrator populates contracts from PREPARE output and detection analysis. Contracts are not hand-written.

### Generation Process

1. Identify sub-scope boundaries from detection analysis (confirmed or adjusted by user)
2. For each sub-scope:
   a. Assign `scope_id` from domain keywords (e.g., "backend-api", "frontend-ui", "database-migration")
   b. List expected deliverables from PREPARE output file references
   c. Identify interface exports/imports by analyzing cross-scope references in PREPARE output
   d. Set shared file constraints by comparing file lists across scopes — when a file appears in multiple scopes' deliverables, assign ownership to one scope (typically the scope with the most significant changes to that file); other scopes list it in `shared_files` (no-modify). The owning scope may modify the file; others must coordinate via the consolidate phase.
   e. Propagate parent conventions (from plan or ARCHITECT output if available)
3. Present contracts in the rePACT invocation prompt for each sub-scope

### Contract Lifecycle

```
Detection fires → User confirms boundaries → Contracts generated
    → Passed to rePACT per sub-scope → Sub-scope executes against contract
    → Sub-scope handoff includes contract fulfillment section
    → Consolidate phase verifies contracts across sub-scopes
```

### Contract Fulfillment in Handoff

When a sub-scope completes, its handoff includes a contract fulfillment section mapping actual outputs to contracted items:

```
Contract Fulfillment:
  Deliverables:
    - ✅ {delivered item} → {actual file/artifact}
    - ❌ {undelivered item} → {reason}
  Interfaces:
    exports: {what was actually exposed}
    imports: {what was actually consumed from siblings}
  Deviations: {any departures from the contract, with rationale}
```

The consolidate phase uses fulfillment sections from all sub-scopes to verify cross-scope compatibility.

### Executor Interface

The executor interface defines the contract between the parent orchestrator and whatever mechanism fulfills a sub-scope. It is the "how" side of the scope contract: while the contract format above defines WHAT a scope delivers, the executor interface defines the input/output shape that any execution backend must implement.

#### Interface Shape

```
Input:
  scope_contract: {the scope contract for this sub-scope}
  feature_context: {parent feature description, branch, relevant docs}
  branch: {current feature branch name}
  nesting_depth: {current nesting level, 0-based}

Output:
  handoff: {standard 5-item handoff + contract fulfillment section}
  commits: {code committed to branch}
  status: completed  # Non-happy-path uses completed with metadata (e.g., {"stalled": true} or {"blocked": true}) per task lifecycle conventions
```

#### Current Executor: rePACT

rePACT implements the executor interface as follows:

| Interface Element | rePACT Implementation |
|-------------------|-----------------------|
| **Input: scope_contract** | Passed inline in the rePACT invocation prompt by the parent orchestrator |
| **Input: feature_context** | Inherited from parent orchestration context (branch, requirements, architecture) |
| **Input: branch** | Uses the current feature branch (no new branch created) |
| **Input: nesting_depth** | Tracked via orchestrator context; enforced at 1-level maximum |
| **Output: handoff** | Standard 5-item handoff with Contract Fulfillment section appended (see rePACT After Completion) |
| **Output: commits** | Code committed directly to the feature branch during Mini-Code phase |
| **Output: status** | Always `completed`; non-happy-path uses metadata (`{"stalled": true, "reason": "..."}` or `{"blocked": true, "blocker_task": "..."}`) per task lifecycle conventions |
| **Delivery mechanism** | Synchronous — agent completes and returns handoff text directly to orchestrator |

See [rePACT.md](../commands/rePACT.md) for the full command documentation, including scope contract reception and contract-aware handoff format.

#### Future Executor: Agent Teams

> **Status**: Agent Teams is experimental, gated behind `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1`.
> The API has evolved from earlier community-documented versions (monolithic `TeammateTool` with 13 operations)
> into separate purpose-built tools. The mappings below reflect the current API shape but may change
> before official release. This section is documentation/future reference, not current behavior.

When Claude Code Agent Teams reaches stable release, it could serve as an alternative executor backend. The interface shape remains the same; only the delivery mechanism changes.

| Interface Element | Agent Teams Mapping |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Input: scope_contract** | Passed in the teammate spawn prompt via `Task` tool (with `team_name` and `name` parameters) |
| **Input: feature_context** | Inherited via CLAUDE.md (auto-loaded by teammates) plus the spawn prompt |
| **Input: branch** | Worktree working directory (teammate operates in the assigned worktree) |
| **Input: nesting_depth** | Communicated in the spawn prompt; no nested teams allowed (enforced by Agent Teams) |
| **Output: handoff** | `SendMessage` (type: `"message"`) from teammate to lead |
| **Output: commits** | Teammate commits directly to the feature branch |
| **Output: status** | `TaskUpdate` via shared task list (`TaskCreate`/`TaskUpdate`/`TaskList`/`TaskGet`) |
| **Delivery mechanism** | Asynchronous — teammates operate independently; lead receives messages and task updates automatically |

**Key Agent Teams tools**:

| Tool | Purpose | PACT Mapping |
|------|---------|--------------|
| `TeamCreate` | Create a team (with `team_name`, optional `description`) | One team per scoped orchestration |
| `Task` (with `team_name`, `name`) | Spawn a teammate into the team | One teammate per sub-scope |
| `SendMessage` (type: `"message"`) | Direct message from teammate to lead | Handoff delivery, blocker reporting |
| `SendMessage` (type: `"broadcast"`) | Message to all teammates | Cross-scope coordination (used sparingly) |
| `SendMessage` (type: `"shutdown_request"`) | Request teammate graceful exit | Sub-scope completion acknowledgment |
| `TaskCreate`/`TaskUpdate` | Shared task list management | Status tracking across sub-scopes |
| `TeamDelete` | Remove team and task directories | Cleanup after scoped orchestration completes |

**Architectural notes**:

- Teammates load CLAUDE.md, MCP servers, and skills automatically but do **not** inherit the lead's conversation history — they receive only the spawn prompt (scope contract + feature context).
- No nested teams are allowed. This parallels PACT's 1-level nesting limit but is enforced architecturally by Agent Teams rather than by convention.
- Agent Teams supports peer-to-peer messaging between teammates (`SendMessage` type: `"message"` with `recipient`), which goes beyond PACT's current hub-and-spoke model. Scoped orchestration would use this for sibling scope coordination during the CONSOLIDATE phase.

#### Design Constraints

- **Backend-agnostic**: The parent orchestrator's logic (contract generation, consolidate phase, failure routing) does not change based on which executor fulfills the scope. Only the dispatch and collection mechanisms differ.
- **Same output shape**: Both rePACT and a future Agent Teams executor produce the same structured output (5-item handoff + contract fulfillment). The consolidate phase consumes this output identically regardless of source.
- **Experimental API**: The Agent Teams tool names documented above reflect the current API shape (as of early 2026). Since the feature is experimental and gated, these names may change before stable release. The executor interface abstraction insulates PACT from such changes — only the mapping table needs updating.

## Scoped Phases (ATOMIZE and CONSOLIDATE)

> **Purpose**: Define the scoped orchestration phases used when decomposition creates sub-scopes.
> These phases replace the standard ARCHITECT and CODE phases when scope detection fires.
> For single-scope workflows, these phases are skipped entirely.

### ATOMIZE Phase

**Skip criteria**: No decomposition occurred (no scope contracts generated) → Proceed to CONSOLIDATE phase.

This phase dispatches sub-scopes for independent execution. Each sub-scope runs a full PACT cycle (Prepare → Architect → Code → Test) via rePACT.

**Worktree isolation**: Before dispatching sub-scopes, create an isolated worktree for each:
1. Invoke `/PACT:worktree-setup` with suffix branch: `feature-X--{scope_id}`
2. Pass the worktree path to the rePACT invocation so the sub-scope operates in its own filesystem

**Dispatch**: Invoke `/PACT:rePACT` for each sub-scope with its scope contract and worktree path. Sub-scopes run concurrently (default) unless they share files. When generating scope contracts, ensure `shared_files` constraints are set per the generation process in [pact-scope-contract.md](pact-scope-contract.md) -- sibling scopes must not modify each other's owned files.

**Sub-scope failure policy**: Sub-scope failure is isolated — sibling scopes continue independently. Individual scope failures route through `/PACT:imPACT` to the affected scope only. However, when a sub-scope emits HALT, the parent orchestrator stops ALL sub-scopes (consistent with algedonic protocol: "Stop ALL agents"). Preserve work-in-progress for all scopes. After HALT resolution, review interrupted scopes before resuming.

**Before next phase**:
- [ ] All sub-scope rePACT cycles complete
- [ ] Contract fulfillment sections received from all sub-scopes
- [ ] If blocker reported → `/PACT:imPACT`
- [ ] **S4 Checkpoint**: All scopes delivered? Any scope stalled?

### CONSOLIDATE Phase

**Skip criteria**: No decomposition occurred → Proceed to TEST phase.

This phase verifies that independently-developed sub-scopes are compatible before comprehensive testing.

**Merge sub-scope branches**: Before running contract verification, merge each sub-scope's work back:
1. For each completed sub-scope, merge its suffix branch to the feature branch
2. Invoke `/PACT:worktree-cleanup` for each sub-scope worktree
3. Proceed to contract verification and integration tests (below) on the merged feature branch

**Delegate in parallel**:
- **`pact-architect`**: Verify cross-scope contract compatibility
  - Compare contract fulfillment sections from all sub-scope handoffs
  - Check that exports from each scope match imports expected by siblings
  - Flag interface mismatches, type conflicts, or undelivered contract items
- **`pact-test-engineer`**: Run cross-scope integration tests
  - Verify cross-scope interfaces work together (API calls, shared types, data flow)
  - Test integration points identified in scope contracts
  - Confirm no shared file constraint violations occurred

**Invoke each with**:
- Feature description and scope contract summaries
- All sub-scope handoffs (contract fulfillment sections)
- "This is cross-scope integration verification. Focus on compatibility between scopes, not internal scope correctness."

**On consolidation failure**: Route through `/PACT:imPACT` for triage. Possible outcomes:
- Interface mismatch → re-invoke affected scope's coder to fix
- Contract deviation → architect reviews whether deviation is acceptable
- Test failure → test engineer provides details, coder fixes

**Before next phase**:
- [ ] Cross-scope contract compatibility verified
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] Specialist handoff(s) received
- [ ] If blocker reported → `/PACT:imPACT`
- [ ] **Create atomic commit(s)** of CONSOLIDATE phase work
- [ ] **S4 Checkpoint**: Scopes compatible? Integration clean? Plan viable?
