## Scope Contract

> **Purpose**: Define what a sub-scope promises to deliver to its parent orchestrator.
> Scope contracts are generated at decomposition time using PREPARE output and serve as
> the authoritative agreement between parent and sub-scope for deliverables and interfaces.

### Contract Format

Each sub-scope receives a scope contract with the following structure:

```
Scope Contract: {scope-name}

Identity:
  scope_id: {kebab-case identifier, e.g., "backend-api"}
  parent_scope: {parent scope_id or "root"}
  executor: {assigned at dispatch — currently rePACT}

Deliverables:
  - {Expected file paths or patterns this scope produces}
  - {Non-file artifacts: API endpoints, schemas, migrations, etc.}

Interfaces:
  exports:
    - {Types, endpoints, APIs this scope exposes to siblings}
  imports:
    - {What this scope expects from sibling scopes}

Constraints:
  shared_files: []  # Files this scope must NOT modify (owned by siblings)
  conventions: []   # Coding conventions to follow (from parent or prior scopes)
```

### Design Principles

- **Minimal contracts** (~5-10 lines per scope): The consolidate phase catches what the contract does not specify. Over-specifying front-loads context cost into the orchestrator.
- **Backend-agnostic**: The contract defines WHAT a scope delivers, not HOW. The same contract format works whether the executor is rePACT (today) or Agent Teams (future).
- **Generated, not authored**: The orchestrator populates contracts from PREPARE output and detection analysis. Contracts are not hand-written.

### Generation Process

1. Identify sub-scope boundaries from detection analysis (confirmed or adjusted by user)
2. For each sub-scope:
   a. Assign `scope_id` from domain keywords (e.g., "backend-api", "frontend-ui", "database-migration")
   b. List expected deliverables from PREPARE output file references
   c. Identify interface exports/imports by analyzing cross-scope references in PREPARE output
   d. Set shared file constraints by comparing file lists across scopes — when a file appears in multiple scopes' deliverables, assign ownership to one scope (typically the scope with the most significant changes to that file); other scopes list it in `shared_files` (no-modify). The owning scope may modify the file; others must coordinate via the consolidate phase.
   e. Propagate parent conventions (from plan or ARCHITECT output if available)
3. Present contracts in the rePACT invocation prompt for each sub-scope

### Contract Lifecycle

```
Detection fires → User confirms boundaries → Contracts generated
    → Passed to rePACT per sub-scope → Sub-scope executes against contract
    → Sub-scope handoff includes contract fulfillment section
    → Consolidate phase verifies contracts across sub-scopes
```

### Contract Fulfillment in Handoff

When a sub-scope completes, its handoff includes a contract fulfillment section mapping actual outputs to contracted items:

```
Contract Fulfillment:
  Deliverables:
    - ✅ {delivered item} → {actual file/artifact}
    - ❌ {undelivered item} → {reason}
  Interfaces:
    exports: {what was actually exposed}
    imports: {what was actually consumed from siblings}
  Deviations: {any departures from the contract, with rationale}
```

The consolidate phase uses fulfillment sections from all sub-scopes to verify cross-scope compatibility.

### Executor Interface

The executor interface defines the contract between the parent orchestrator and whatever mechanism fulfills a sub-scope. It is the "how" side of the scope contract: while the contract format above defines WHAT a scope delivers, the executor interface defines the input/output shape that any execution backend must implement.

#### Interface Shape

```
Input:
  scope_contract: {the scope contract for this sub-scope}
  feature_context: {parent feature description, branch, relevant docs}
  branch: {current feature branch name}
  nesting_depth: {current nesting level, 0-based}

Output:
  handoff: {standard 5-item handoff + contract fulfillment section}
  commits: {code committed to branch}
  status: completed  # Non-happy-path uses completed with metadata (e.g., {"stalled": true} or {"blocked": true}) per task lifecycle conventions
```

#### Current Executor: rePACT

rePACT implements the executor interface as follows:

| Interface Element | rePACT Implementation |
|-------------------|-----------------------|
| **Input: scope_contract** | Passed inline in the rePACT invocation prompt by the parent orchestrator |
| **Input: feature_context** | Inherited from parent orchestration context (branch, requirements, architecture) |
| **Input: branch** | Uses the current feature branch (no new branch created) |
| **Input: nesting_depth** | Tracked via orchestrator context; enforced at 1-level maximum |
| **Output: handoff** | Standard 5-item handoff with Contract Fulfillment section appended (see [rePACT After Completion](../commands/rePACT.md)) |
| **Output: commits** | Code committed directly to the feature branch during Mini-Code phase |
| **Output: status** | Always `completed`; non-happy-path uses metadata (`{"stalled": true, "reason": "..."}` or `{"blocked": true, "blocker_task": "..."}`) per task lifecycle conventions |
| **Delivery mechanism** | Synchronous — agent completes and returns handoff text directly to orchestrator |

See [rePACT.md](../commands/rePACT.md) for the full command documentation, including scope contract reception and contract-aware handoff format.

#### Future Executor: Agent Teams

> **Status**: Agent Teams is experimental, gated behind `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1`.
> The API has evolved from earlier community-documented versions (monolithic `TeammateTool` with 13 operations)
> into separate purpose-built tools. The mappings below reflect the current API shape but may change
> before official release. This section is documentation/future reference, not current behavior.

When Claude Code Agent Teams reaches stable release, it could serve as an alternative executor backend. The interface shape remains the same; only the delivery mechanism changes.

| Interface Element | Agent Teams Mapping |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Input: scope_contract** | Passed in the teammate spawn prompt via `Task` tool (with `team_name` and `name` parameters) |
| **Input: feature_context** | Inherited via CLAUDE.md (auto-loaded by teammates) plus the spawn prompt |
| **Input: branch** | Worktree working directory (teammate operates in the assigned worktree) |
| **Input: nesting_depth** | Communicated in the spawn prompt; no nested teams allowed (enforced by Agent Teams) |
| **Output: handoff** | `SendMessage` (type: `"message"`) from teammate to lead |
| **Output: commits** | Teammate commits directly to the feature branch |
| **Output: status** | `TaskUpdate` via shared task list (`TaskCreate`/`TaskUpdate`/`TaskList`/`TaskGet`) |
| **Delivery mechanism** | Asynchronous — teammates operate independently; lead receives messages and task updates automatically |

**Key Agent Teams tools**:

| Tool | Purpose | PACT Mapping |
|------|---------|--------------|
| `TeamCreate` | Create a team (with `team_name`, optional `description`) | One team per scoped orchestration |
| `Task` (with `team_name`, `name`) | Spawn a teammate into the team | One teammate per sub-scope |
| `SendMessage` (type: `"message"`) | Direct message from teammate to lead | Handoff delivery, blocker reporting |
| `SendMessage` (type: `"broadcast"`) | Message to all teammates | Cross-scope coordination (used sparingly) |
| `SendMessage` (type: `"shutdown_request"`) | Request teammate graceful exit | Sub-scope completion acknowledgment |
| `TaskCreate`/`TaskUpdate` | Shared task list management | Status tracking across sub-scopes |
| `TeamDelete` | Remove team and task directories | Cleanup after scoped orchestration completes |

**Architectural notes**:

- Teammates load CLAUDE.md, MCP servers, and skills automatically but do **not** inherit the lead's conversation history — they receive only the spawn prompt (scope contract + feature context).
- No nested teams are allowed. This parallels PACT's 1-level nesting limit but is enforced architecturally by Agent Teams rather than by convention.
- Agent Teams supports peer-to-peer messaging between teammates (`SendMessage` type: `"message"` with `recipient`), which goes beyond PACT's current hub-and-spoke model. Scoped orchestration would use this for sibling scope coordination during the CONSOLIDATE phase.

#### Design Constraints

- **Backend-agnostic**: The parent orchestrator's logic (contract generation, consolidate phase, failure routing) does not change based on which executor fulfills the scope. Only the dispatch and collection mechanisms differ.
- **Same output shape**: Both rePACT and a future Agent Teams executor produce the same structured output (5-item handoff + contract fulfillment). The consolidate phase consumes this output identically regardless of source.
- **Experimental API**: The Agent Teams tool names documented above reflect the current API shape (as of early 2026). Since the feature is experimental and gated, these names may change before stable release. The executor interface abstraction insulates PACT from such changes — only the mapping table needs updating.
