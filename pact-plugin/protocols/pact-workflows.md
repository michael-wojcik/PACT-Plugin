## The PACT Workflow Family

| Workflow | When to Use | Key Idea |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **PACT** | Complex/greenfield work | Context-aware multi-agent orchestration |
| **plan-mode** | Before complex work, need alignment | Multi-agent planning consultation, no implementation |
| **comPACT** | Focused, single-domain tasks | Single-domain delegation with light ceremony (parallelizable) |
| **rePACT** | Complex sub-tasks within orchestration | Recursive nested P→A→C→T cycle (single or multi-domain) |
| **imPACT** | When blocked or need to iterate | Triage: Redo prior phase? Additional agents needed? |

## plan-mode Protocol

**Purpose**: Multi-agent planning consultation before implementation. Get specialist perspectives synthesized into an actionable plan.

**When to use**:
- Complex features where upfront alignment prevents rework
- Tasks spanning multiple specialist domains
- When you want user approval before implementation begins
- Greenfield work with significant architectural decisions

**Four phases**:

| Phase | What Happens |
|-------|--------------|
| 0. Analyze | Orchestrator assesses scope, selects relevant specialists |
| 1. Consult | Specialists provide planning perspectives in parallel |
| 2. Synthesize | Orchestrator resolves conflicts, sequences work, assesses risk |
| 3. Present | Save plan to `docs/plans/`, present to user, await approval |

**Key rules**:
- **No implementation** — planning consultation only
- **No git branch** — that happens when `/PACT:orchestrate` runs
- Specialists operate in "planning-only mode" (analysis, not action)
- Conflicts surfaced and resolved (or flagged for user decision)

**Output**: `docs/plans/{feature-slug}-plan.md`

**After approval**: User runs `/PACT:orchestrate {task}`, which references the plan.

**When to recommend alternatives**:
- Trivial task → `/PACT:comPACT`
- Unclear requirements → Ask clarifying questions first
- Need research before planning → Run preparation phase alone first

## imPACT Protocol

**Trigger when**: Blocked; get similar errors repeatedly; or prior phase output is wrong.

**Two questions**:
1. **Redo prior phase?** — Is the issue upstream in P→A→C→T?
2. **Additional agents needed?** — Do I need subagents to assist?

**Three outcomes**:
| Outcome | When | Action |
|---------|------|--------|
| Redo solo | Prior phase broken, I can fix it | Loop back and fix yourself |
| Redo with help | Prior phase broken, need specialist | Loop back with subagent assistance |
| Proceed with help | Current phase correct, blocked on execution | Invoke subagents to help forward |

If neither question is "Yes," you're not blocked—continue.

## comPACT Protocol

**Core idea**: Single-DOMAIN delegation with light ceremony.

comPACT handles tasks within ONE specialist domain. For independent sub-tasks, it can invoke MULTIPLE specialists of the same type in parallel.

**Available specialists**:
| Shorthand | Specialist | Use For |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| `backend` | pact-backend-coder | Server-side logic, APIs, middleware |
| `frontend` | pact-frontend-coder | UI, React, client-side |
| `database` | pact-database-engineer | Schema, queries, migrations |
| `prepare` | pact-preparer | Research, requirements |
| `test` | pact-test-engineer | Standalone test tasks |
| `architect` | pact-architect | Design guidance, pattern selection |

**Smart specialist selection**:
- *Clear task* → Auto-select (domain keywords, file types, single-domain action)
- *Ambiguous task* → Ask user which specialist

### When to Invoke Multiple Specialists

**MANDATORY: parallel unless tasks share files.** comPACT invokes multiple agents of the same type for independent items.

Invoke multiple specialists of the same type when:
- Multiple independent items (bugs, components, endpoints)
- No shared files between sub-tasks
- Same patterns/conventions apply to all

| Task | Agents Invoked |
|------|----------------|
| "Fix 3 backend bugs" | 3 backend-coders (parallel) |
| "Add validation to 5 endpoints" | Multiple backend-coders (parallel) |
| "Update styling on 3 components" | Multiple frontend-coders (parallel) |

### Pre-Invocation (Required)

1. **Set up worktree** — If already in a worktree for this feature, reuse it. Otherwise, invoke `/PACT:worktree-setup` with the feature branch name. All subsequent work happens in the worktree.
2. **Verify session team exists** — The `{team_name}` team should already exist from session start. If not, create it now: `TeamCreate(team_name="{team_name}")`.
3. **S2 coordination** (if concurrent) — Check for file conflicts, assign boundaries

### S2 Light Coordination (for parallel comPACT)

1. **Check for conflicts** — Do any sub-tasks touch the same files?
2. **Assign boundaries** — If conflicts exist, sequence or define clear boundaries
3. **Set convention authority** — First agent's choices become standard for the batch

### Light ceremony instructions (injected when invoking specialist)

- Work directly from task description
- Check docs/plans/, docs/preparation/, docs/architecture/ briefly if they exist—reference relevant context
- Do not create new documentation artifacts
- Smoke tests only: Verify it compiles, runs, and happy path doesn't crash (no comprehensive unit tests—that's TEST phase work)

**Escalate to `/PACT:orchestrate` when**:
- Task spans multiple specialist domains
- Complex cross-domain coordination needed
- Specialist reports a blocker (run `/PACT:imPACT` first)

### After Specialist Completes

1. **Receive handoff** from specialist(s)
2. **Run tests** — verify work passes. If tests fail → return to specialist for fixes before committing.
3. **Create atomic commit(s)** — stage and commit before proceeding

**Next steps** — After commit, ask: "Work committed. Create PR?"
- Yes (Recommended) → invoke `/PACT:peer-review`
- Not yet → worktree persists; user resumes later. Clean up manually with `/PACT:worktree-cleanup` when done.
- More work → continue with comPACT or orchestrate

**If blocker reported**:
1. Receive blocker from specialist
2. Run `/PACT:imPACT` to triage
3. May escalate to `/PACT:orchestrate` if task exceeds single-specialist scope
