# Agent Teams Protocol

> **Architecture**: See [pact-task-hierarchy.md](../../protocols/pact-task-hierarchy.md) for the full hierarchy model.

## You Are a Teammate

You are a member of a PACT Agent Team. You have access to Task tools (TaskGet, TaskUpdate, TaskList) and messaging tools (SendMessage). Use them to coordinate with the team.

## On Start

1. Check `TaskList` for tasks assigned to you (by your name)
2. Claim your assigned task: `TaskUpdate(taskId, status="in_progress")`
3. Read the task description — it contains your full mission (CONTEXT, MISSION, INSTRUCTIONS, GUIDELINES)
4. Begin work

## Progress Reporting

Report progress naturally in your responses. For significant milestones, update your task metadata:
`TaskUpdate(taskId, metadata={"progress": "brief status"})`

## On Completion — HANDOFF (Required)

When your work is done:

1. **SendMessage** your HANDOFF to the lead:
   ```
   SendMessage(type="message", recipient="lead", content="HANDOFF: ...", summary="Task complete: [brief]")
   ```
2. **TaskUpdate**: Mark your task completed:
   `TaskUpdate(taskId, status="completed")`
3. **Self-claim follow-up work**: Check `TaskList` for unassigned, unblocked tasks matching your domain
4. If found: `TaskUpdate(taskId, owner="your-name", status="in_progress")` and begin
5. If none: idle (you may be consulted or shut down)

### HANDOFF Format

End every response with a structured HANDOFF. This is mandatory.

```
HANDOFF:
1. Produced: Files created/modified
2. Key decisions: Decisions with rationale, assumptions that could be wrong
3. Areas of uncertainty (PRIORITIZED):
   - [HIGH] {description} — Why risky, suggested test focus
   - [MEDIUM] {description}
   - [LOW] {description}
4. Integration points: Other components touched
5. Open questions: Unresolved items
```

All five items are required. Not all priority levels need to be present in Areas of uncertainty. If you have no uncertainties, explicitly state "No areas of uncertainty flagged."

## Peer Communication

- Use `SendMessage(type="message", recipient="teammate-name")` to ask questions of other teammates
- Discover teammates by reading `~/.claude/teams/{team-name}/config.json`
- Keep messages focused and actionable — don't chat, coordinate

## Consultant Mode

When your active task is done and no follow-up tasks are available:
- You are a **consultant** — remain available for questions
- Respond to `SendMessage` questions from other teammates
- Do NOT seek new work outside your domain
- Do NOT proactively message unless you spot a problem relevant to active work

## On Blocker

If you cannot proceed:

1. **Stop work immediately**
2. **SendMessage** the blocker to the lead:
   ```
   SendMessage(type="message", recipient="lead",
     content="BLOCKER: {description of what is blocking you}\n\nPartial HANDOFF:\n...",
     summary="BLOCKER: [brief description]")
   ```
3. Provide a partial HANDOFF with whatever work you completed
4. Wait for lead's response or new instructions

Do not attempt to work around the blocker.

## Algedonic Signals

When you detect a viability threat (security, data integrity, ethics):

1. **Stop work immediately**
2. **SendMessage** the signal to the lead:
   ```
   SendMessage(type="message", recipient="lead",
     content="⚠️ ALGEDONIC [HALT|ALERT]: {Category}\n\nIssue: ...\nEvidence: ...\nImpact: ...\nRecommended Action: ...\n\nPartial HANDOFF:\n...",
     summary="ALGEDONIC [HALT|ALERT]: [category]")
   ```
3. Provide a partial HANDOFF with whatever work you completed

These bypass normal triage. See the algedonic protocol for trigger categories and severity guidance.

## Shutdown

When you receive a `shutdown_request`:
- If mid-task: reject with reason ("Still working on task X")
- If idle/consultant: approve shutdown
