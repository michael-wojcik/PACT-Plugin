Location: pact-plugin/hooks/teammate_idle.py
Summary: TeammateIdle hook with two responsibilities: stall detection and idle
         cleanup. Detects agents that go idle without completing or reporting
         blockers, and tracks consecutive idle events for completed agents to
         suggest or force shutdown.
Used by: hooks.json TeammateIdle hook

Stall detection: If a teammate goes idle while their task is still in_progress
and no HANDOFF or BLOCKER was sent, emit a systemMessage alerting the
orchestrator to consider /PACT:imPACT.

Idle cleanup: Track consecutive idle events for completed agents. After 3,
suggest shutdown. After 5, request shutdown via shutdown_request.

Input: JSON from stdin with teammate_name, team_name
Output: JSON with systemMessage (stall alert or shutdown suggestion)
