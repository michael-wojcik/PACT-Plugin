Location: pact-plugin/hooks/task_completed.py
Summary: TaskCompleted hook for PACT v3.0 Agent Teams.
Used by: hooks.json TaskCompleted event registration

Fires when a task is being marked complete. Currently a placeholder
that always allows completion (exit 0). The skip_prefixes structure
is in place for when validation is added.

Input (env vars): TASK_ID, TASK_SUBJECT, TASK_DESCRIPTION, TEAMMATE_NAME, TEAM_NAME

Note: This hook needs empirical validation. The TaskCompleted event
behavior (env vars available, metadata access, exit code semantics)
is based on platform documentation but has not been tested in production.
TODO: Once TaskGet access from hooks is confirmed empirically,
this hook should validate that the task has proper handoff metadata
(produced, decisions, uncertainties, integration_points, open_questions)
before allowing completion (exit 2 to prevent completion with feedback).
