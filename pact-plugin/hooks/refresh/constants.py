Summary: Configuration constants for the workflow refresh system.
Used by: All refresh modules for consistent threshold and limit values.

This module centralizes configuration constants that may need tuning,
keeping regex patterns and workflow definitions in patterns.py while
extracting tunable numeric values here for maintainability.

STEP_DESCRIPTIONS and PROSE_CONTEXT_TEMPLATES are imported from
shared_constants.py to eliminate code duplication with compaction_refresh.py.
