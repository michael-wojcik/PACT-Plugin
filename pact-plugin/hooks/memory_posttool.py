"""
Location: pact-plugin/hooks/memory_posttool.py
Summary: PostToolUse hook that reminds agent to consider saving memory after edits.
Used by: Claude Code settings.json PostToolUse hook (Edit, Write tools)

PHILOSOPHY: Bias toward saving memories. The pact-memory-agent stays alive
as a consultant after initial dispatch, so subsequent saves via SendMessage
have minimal overhead. Better to save too much than lose context.

Always fires after Edit/Write to provide contextual guidance. The agent
decides based on whether they've completed a unit of work or are mid-task.

Input: JSON from stdin with tool_name, tool_input, tool_output
Output: JSON with `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext` on every edit
